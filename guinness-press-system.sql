The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Prevented WU Lecturers From Engaging In Face-To-Face Learning. Socrative, Microsoft Team, And Other E-Learning Programs Were Among The Various Remote Teaching Applications That Were Used During This Period. However, Because Of The Alleged High Levels Of Reliability And Effectiveness, The Researcher Concentrated On A Proprietary E-Learning Application, Socrative. Method: This Study Used A Mixed Method Of Quantitative And Qualitative Research Design To Investi- Gate The Sampled Population Of (N=90) Second-Year Undergraduate Students’ Attitudes Toward Using Socrative As An Online Teaching Tool And Real-Time Feedback After Having Used The Aforemen- Tioned Application For Three Months During The COVID-19) Pandemic. Results: The Findings Revealed That Socrative Is Indeed A Useful Tool That Educators Can Use To Improve Digital Learning Outcomes Such As Learning Engagement. The Results Also Revealed That Gender Did Not Have Any Statistically Significant Influence On Students’ Attitudes Towards The Use Of Socrative Applications For Online Teaching. Conclusion: According To The Findings, Socrative Application Appears To Be Suitable For Remote Teaching And Learning During The Covid-19 Pandemic In This Digital Era Because Of The Most Import- Ant Characteristics Of Socrative Application, Such As Its Ease Of Use, Straightforwardness, Minimal Hardware Requirements, And A Long List Of Useful Features.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">[1] Adnan M, Obyedul Kalam Azad M, Madhusudhan A, Saravanakumar K, Hu X, Wang MH, Ha CD.Simple and cleaner system of silver nanoparticle synthesis using kenaf seed and revealing its anticancer and antimicrobial potential.

The Study Involved A Control Group That Relied On Tradi- Tional Textbook Materials And An Experimental Group That Was Exposed To Authentic Materials With The Sample Population Of 111 Students Who Took GEN60-116- English For Community Develop- Ment Course In Term/1/ 2018 At Walailak University With The Course Duration Of 13 Weeks. Post- Test Results Were Analyzed And Compared To Pre-Test Scores For Both Groups. The Control Group\'s Post-Test Scores Were Lower Than Their Pre-Test Scores, Suggesting That The Traditional Textbook Approach May Not Effectively Support Language Learning Needs. In Contrast, The Experimental Group\'s Post-Test Scores Surpassed Their Pre-Test Scores, Indicating That Exposure To Authentic Materials Had A Positive Impact On Their Language Learning Outcomes. The Study\'s Findings Align With The Previous Studies On The Benefits Of Authentic Materials In Language Instruction, As Expo- Sure To Authentic Materials Can Enhance Vocabulary Acquisition, Listening Comprehension, Reading Comprehension, Writing Skills, And Overall Language Proficiency. These Results Have Significant Implications For Language Teachers And Curriculum Designers. This Study Suggests That Incorpo- Rating Authentic Materials In Language Instruction Can Enhance Language Learning Outcomes, En- Abling Learners To Develop A Deeper Understanding Of The Language And Its Usage In Authentic Contexts.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">[1] Brandl, K.

As A Result Of Societal Factors, The Legal Policies Of A Number Of Nations, Including Vietnam, Include Infanticide As A Crime With A Number Of Special Components, Such As The Offender Endangering The Life Of A Special Victim Under No Less Extraordinary Situations And Circumstances.

The Findings Indicate That Participants Have An Average Degree Of Awareness Regarding Circular Economy Concepts. While Some Organizations Have Completely Or Partially Implemented Circular Economy Principles, A Significant Portion Has Not Yet Integrated Them, Suggesting A Need For More Initiatives. Financial Limita- Tions, Supply Chain Restrictions, And A Lack Of Knowledge Are The Primary Barriers To Adoption. Employee Knowledge And Comprehension Of Circular Economy Concepts Have Room For Improvement. Commonly Implemented Circular Practices Include Renewable Energy Use, Material Recycling, And Product Lifespan Extension. Perceived Benefits Include Cost Savings, Resource Conservation, And Increased Stakeholder Participation. Sustainability May Not Be Considered Important In Overall Strategy And Decision-Making By A Majority Of Participants. Financial Or Operational Difficulties Are Experienced By Some Organizations During The Adoption Of Circular Economy Principles. Motivators For Embracing Circular Economy Include Cost Savings, Brand Reputation, Regulatory Compliance, And Stakeholder Expectations. Participants Highlight A Need For More Support And Resources To Implement Circular Economy Projects. Overall, The Survey High- Lights The Varying Levels Of Familiarity, Integration, Challenges, Awareness, And Understanding Of Circular Economy Concepts Among Participants, And Underscores The Importance Of Addressing Barriers, Raising Awareness, And Providing Sufficient Support And Resources For Advancing Circular Economy Principles.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Brown, H., and Evans, S.

Sometimes, The Object Will Simply Be A Copy Of An Existing Commercial Product. Likewise, There Are Few Reports On The Ethical Considerations Regarding 3d Printing, Especially In The Philippines Where Piracy Or Illegal Copying Is Rampant. Thus, The Ethical Perspective Of This Venture Was Taken Into Consideration. Integrative Review Combining Meta-Analysis And Synthesis As A Research Design For This Study Was Facilitated Through A Liter - Ature And Study Review Using PRISMA. Studies On The Ethical Perspectives Of 3D Printing Were Searched Through The Electronic Databases ProQuest, Elsevier, CINAHL, PubMed, Medline Plus, And Ebsco. The Search For Studies Harvested 186 Articles Of Which Were Searched Through The Mentioned Databases. Out Of These Articles, 62 Studies Met The Inclusion Criteria. The Data Provided By These Studies Were Compiled, Organized By Themes Noting Similarities And Differences. After A More And Thorough Review, 8 Studies Ex- Actly And Completely Fit All The Protocols And Findings Needed To Be Included In This Study. Findings Revealed Issues On The Protocol Development In The Ethical Conduct Of 3D Printing In Particular To Prototyping And Rapid Manufacturing; Research On The Ethical Conduct Of 3D Printing Are Also Lacking And Post-Evaluation On The Conduct Of 3D Printing As Applied To The Its Purpose Were Not Considered In The Existing Laws And Regulations. All The 8 Studies On The Ethical Perspective On 3D Printing Are Unique In Their Methods, Sam - Pling, Data Treatment, Results And More Importantly, Findings But Their Focus Is Shared. More So, The Study Suggests Further Looking At The Impact Of Certain Amendments On The Laws And Policies In 3D Printing To Its Ethics Components And Relating This To Policy Formulation That Protects All Stakeholders’ Interests In This Emerging Technological Industry. Users And Manufacturers Of 3D Printers And 3D Printed Objects Will Encounter Issues Involving Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, And Other IP Rights Is A Reality In The Future.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Dodds, Susan (2015). 3D printing can offer great benefits in medicine, but it also raises a number of ethical ques- tions as the technology develops, says Susan Dodds. 3D Bioprinting: Printing Parts for Bodies. http://www.abc.net.au/science/ articles/2015/02/11/4161675. htm</li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Vincent J (2014) Three quarters of the IKEA cat- alogue is CGI.

A Random Sample Of 372 Household Heads In A Total Of 12,071 Households (PHO, 2021) In The Municipality Served As Re- Spondents Of The Study. A Validated And Pilot-Tested Researcher-Made Questionnaire Was Used As Re- Search Instrument Distributed Using Both Online Platform (Google Forms) And In Printed Questionnaire. Findings Indicate That Household Heads In The Municipality Of Pontevedra Are Mostly Females, In Their Mid-Forties, Married, Roman Catholic, College Graduate, Headed A Household Of Fi E With A Family Member Of Less Than 5 Years Old And A Senior Citizen, Unemployed, With Family Monthly In- Come Below The Poverty Line, No Medical Insurance And Stayed In The Place For A Quarter Of A Cen- Tury. Majority Of The HH Heads Have Not Been Tested For COVID-19, Has Not Been Diagnosed By Health Care Professionals Based On Symptoms Only, Had No In-Person Contact With Anyone Infect- Ed With COVID-19; And Majority Of Them Have No Comorbidities Or Pre-Existing Health Conditions. Moreover, HH Heads Are Aware That They Are Quite Unlikely To Get COVID-19 And Very Close- Ly Complied About Guidelines For COVID-19. Most Of The HH Heads In Pontevedra Are COVID-19 Vaccine Confident, Have A High Level Of Social Cohesion And Trust During COVID-19, Somewhat Sat- Isfied With The COVID-19 Control, And Somewhat Agree To Receive COVID-19 Vaccination. There Are Significant Differences On The Mean Vaccine Confidence Scores When HH Heads Are Classified According To Their Age, Highest Educational Attainment, Employment Sta- Tus, And Family Monthly Income. COVID-19 Vaccination Response Of HH Heads Was Significan - Ly Related With Their Profile Variables (Highest Educational Attainment, Employment Status, And Estimated Monthly Income), Their COVID-19-Related Profile, Their Extent Of COVID-19 Impact, Their Level Of Social Cohesion And Trust, And Their Level Of Satisfaction With The COVID-19 Control.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Badura, S.

The VMGO Serve As The Guiding Principles For UCU’s Strategic Planning And Decision-Making Processes, Shaping The Institution’s Identity And Direction. However, The Effectiveness Of These VMGO Relies On Their Dissemination Among The Primary Stakeholders, The Students. This Research Aimed To Assess The Current State Of Dissemination Of UCU’s VMGO And Identify Potential Ethical Implications Arising From Any Gaps Or Shortcomings In These Processes. The Study Employed A Mixed-Methods Approach, Combining Surveys, Document Analysis And Philosophical Interpretation. The Survey Gathered Quantitative Data Regarding Stakeholders’ Experiences On The Dissemination Of The VMGO, While Philosophical Interpretation Provided In-Depth Insights Of Ethical Implication Into Their Perceptions And Experiences. Additionally, An Analysis Of Relevant Documents, Such As Official University Publications And Communication Materials, Provided Contextual Information. The Study Concluded That UCU Can Strengthen Its Commitment To Integrity, Teamwork, Competence And Transcendence That Will Foster A Sense Of Purpose, Honesty, Accuracy, Alignment, Responsibility, Respect, Collaboration And Societal Impact Within The University Community. By Upholding These Values, UCU Can Strengthen Its Commitment To Ethical Practices, Maintain The Integrity Of Its Messaging, Encourage Collaboration And Inclusivity, Enhance Competence, And Promote Positive Societal Impact.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Adnan, N., &amp; Mahmood, N.

This Is Descriptive Qualitative Research Anchoring From Stake’s Model In Conducting A Case Study. This Study Covered Four (4) Female Orphans As Case Participants From The Orphanage, Whose Ages Range From 8 To 18, With Different Narratives And Life Stories. In This Study, It Emerged That Their Stepmother, Stepfather, And Stepbrother Emotionally, Physically, And Sexually Abused Them As The Majority Of The Themes They Experienced. The Cited Abuse Is Considered One Of The Primary Reasons That Brought The Children To The Orphanage. The Children’s Coping Mechanisms In The Orphanage Are Positively Affected By The People Who Saved And Brought Them Into It. The Activities In The Orphanage, Such As Attending Mass And Praying, Helped Them Strengthen Their Faith In God, Eventually Lightening Their Burden; Other Than Leaving Their Negative Experiences, The Orphans’ Aspirations In The Orphanage Are To Finish Their Education And Help Others, Especially Their Siblings.</span><br></div>', '<div><ul class=\"reference-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 12px 2px; scrollbar-width: auto; scrollbar-color: rgb(57, 110, 181) rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; gap: 30px; border-radius: 34px; align-items: center;\">Burns, N. &amp; Grove, S.K.

Urban and rural renewal is a necessary supplement to the development of high-speed urbanization. Rapid development will lead to a large number of problems such as overproduction, energy waste, and unbalanced resource allocation. These problems will reduce people\'s quality of life and the sustainability of future development. Discussing more new low-carbon building technologies in urban and rural renewal can effectively solve the conflict between people\'s increasing demand for quality of life and high energy consumption. At the same time, we also have to face up to the imbalance between urban and rural development.

The corresponding author is\n                tasked with the submission and will work closely with the Editorial Office\n                throughout the process. Prior to submission, the corresponding author must\n                confirm that all authors listed adhere to the authorship criteria outlined\n                by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and COPE.\n            </p>\n            <h3>3. Cover Letter</h3>\n            <p>\n                During manuscript submission, the corresponding author is required to\n                include a cover letter, outlining the manuscript\'s significance. This letter\n                should affirm, on behalf of all authors, that the submission is original and\n                not under consideration or published elsewhere. Additionally, it should\n                confirm agreement among all authors regarding authorship and state the\n                absence of disputes.

Utilize this\n                numbering system for internal cross-references, avoiding vague references to\n                \'the text\'. If necessary, provide concise headings for each subsection,\n                ensuring each heading begins on a separate line.\n            </p>\n            <h3>7. Highlights:</h3>\n            <p>\n                While optional, we strongly encourage authors to include this section, as it\n                could enhance the visibility of your articles. We invite you to summarize\n                the key points of your article in 3 to 5 bullet points, enhancing its\n                discoverability on search engines.

The corresponding author is\n                tasked with the submission and will work closely with the Editorial Office\n                throughout the process. Prior to submission, the corresponding author must\n                confirm that all authors listed adhere to the authorship criteria outlined\n                by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and COPE.\n            </p>\n            <h3>3. Cover Letter</h3>\n            <p>\n                During manuscript submission, the corresponding author is required to\n                include a cover letter, outlining the manuscript\'s significance. This letter\n                should affirm, on behalf of all authors, that the submission is original and\n                not under consideration or published elsewhere. Additionally, it should\n                confirm agreement among all authors regarding authorship and state the\n                absence of disputes.

Utilize this\n                numbering system for internal cross-references, avoiding vague references to\n                \'the text\'. If necessary, provide concise headings for each subsection,\n                ensuring each heading begins on a separate line.\n            </p>\n            <h3>7. Highlights:</h3>\n            <p>\n                While optional, we strongly encourage authors to include this section, as it\n                could enhance the visibility of your articles. We invite you to summarize\n                the key points of your article in 3 to 5 bullet points, enhancing its\n                discoverability on search engines.
