                          Dr. Caroline Cox is an Associate Professor specializing in Wildlife Law & Policy at the University of Portsmouth. As the lead researcher of the Ivory Project, initiated in November 2015, Dr. Cox has been instrumental in analyzing the illegal ivory trade both in the U.K. and internationally. Her research extends to various aspects of illegal wildlife trade, addressing issues such as pangolin trafficking and rhino poaching.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          In collaboration with Dr. Nick Pamment, Dr. Cox launched The Ivory Project at the House of Commons in November 2015. This groundbreaking project focused on investigating the sale of ivory by the British antiques trade and lasted for 18 months. The culmination of their efforts was the release of a comprehensive report titled 'The Elephant in the Sale Room.'
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Dr. Cox's impactful report played a crucial role in the British Government's Impact Assessment, influencing changes in the law related to ivory sales in the U.K. The Ivory Act 2018, enacted on December 18, 2018, reflected the significant contributions of the Ivory Project team.

It has also changed the culture of organizations. Digital technologies allow people to work from anywhere and keep them connected with the organization all the time. As a result, workers are expected to be available and responsive outside of traditional work hours. Digitalization has made it easier and more efficient for organizations to gather and analyzed data. Digital tools also make it easier for organizations to talk to their customers in a more personalized and focused way, which is another way that digitalization affects organizational culture. Thus, due to digitalization, the culture of the organization has changed a lot. It is thus, obligated for the organizations to keep updated on the challenges as well and bring necessary changes within the organization.",

                online teaching tool and a student smart response system (SRS) in real-time during the Covid-19
                school closure at Walailak University (WU). The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented WU lecturers
                from engaging in face-to-face learning. Socrative, Microsoft Team, and other e-learning programs
                were among the various remote teaching applications that were used during this period. However,
                because of the alleged high levels of reliability and effectiveness, the researcher concentrated on
                a proprietary e-learning application, Socrative.
                Method: This study used a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative research design to investi-
                gate the sampled population of (n=90) second-year undergraduate students’ attitudes toward
                using Socrative as an online teaching tool and real-time feedback after having used the aforemen-
                tioned application for three months during the COVID-19) pandemic.
                Results: The findings revealed that Socrative is indeed a useful tool that educators can use to
                improve digital learning outcomes such as learning engagement. The results also revealed that
                gender did not have any statistically significant influence on students’ attitudes towards the
                use of Socrative applications for online teaching.
                Conclusion: According to the findings, Socrative application appears to be suitable for remote
                teaching and learning during the covid-19 pandemic in this digital era because of the most import-
                ant characteristics of Socrative application, such as its ease of use, straightforwardness, minimal
                hardware requirements, and a long list of useful features.",

                result, when parents’ divorce, the parenting role will be divided and changed in the legal and
                implementation aspects. One of the solutions provided by law to contribute to “narrowing” the gap
                after the divorce between parents and children is visitation rights. Albeit clear and specific legal
                provisions, when applied in practice, visitation rights are not easily exercised and even, in many
                cases, are obstructed by the custodial parent. Within the scope of the article, the author will ana-
                lyze and clarify the contents of the visitation privilege of policy established by Vietnam and other
                regions across the globe. The research epahsize on the visitation rights and divorce of mother and
                father from a human rights perspective, granting of custody, change of custody, and recommenda-
                tions for improvement of the law on visitation rights. Thereby, new directions will be suggested to

                learning outcomes in ESL/EFL learners. The study involved a control group that relied on tradi-
                tional textbook materials and an experimental group that was exposed to authentic materials with
                the sample population of 111 students who took GEN60-116- English for Community Develop-
                ment course in term/1/ 2018 at Walailak University with the course duration of 13 weeks. Post-
                test results were analyzed and compared to pre-test scores for both groups. The control group's
                post-test scores were lower than their pre-test scores, suggesting that the traditional textbook
                approach may not effectively support language learning needs. In contrast, the experimental
                group's post-test scores surpassed their pre-test scores, indicating that exposure to authentic
                materials had a positive impact on their language learning outcomes. The study's findings align
                with the previous studies on the benefits of authentic materials in language instruction, as expo-
                sure to authentic materials can enhance vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension, reading
                comprehension, writing skills, and overall language proficiency. These results have significant
                implications for language teachers and curriculum designers. This study suggests that incorpo-
                rating authentic materials in language instruction can enhance language learning outcomes, en-
                abling learners to develop a deeper understanding of the language and its usage in authentic
                contexts.",

                        culture; however, a mother’s cruel rejection of such humanistic emotion and ending the life
                        of the child she struggled to conceive and give birth to produces uneasiness and mistrust in
                        people. There must be a reason why an average person would violate this consistent moral
                        requirement. As a result of societal factors, the legal policies of a number of nations, including
                        Vietnam, include infanticide as a crime with a number of special components, such as the
                        offender endangering the life of a special victim under no less extraordinary situations and
                        circumstances. All of the above distinctive conditions also produce a unique crime that
                        partially reflects the state’s humanitarian policy. Due to the unique character of this offence,
                        the legislation governing its implementation and enforcement must be carefully addressed.
                        This article compares and contrasts Vietnamese law with the legal systems of countries that
                        record infanticide as a crime, analyses and researches with an interdisciplinary approach to
                        identify outstanding deficiencies, improve Vietnamese criminal law, ensure the criminal law’s
                        adaptability to changing times, and better protect the rights of newborn children and mothers.",

                "abstract"=>"Thermal comfort refers to a situation where human feels satisfied with the environment's
                    temperature. There is no absolute thermal comfort level that applies to all human, since it is a
                    subjective situation that differ from one person to another. This study's objective is to identify
                    Malaysian thermal comfort level and physical performances under simulation chamber experiment
                    set-tings. Three young and healthy males with no medical issues were chosen as study
                    respondents. There were four settings in this study; (i) 25°C with 70 RH, (ii) 34°C with 92% RH,
                    (iii) 34°C with 74% RH and (v) 38°C with 83% RH . Respondents were required to imitate
                    construction workers lifting task under the four environment settings. This study findings show a
                    noticeable association between an increase in temperature towards heart rate level. As the
                    temperature rises up, respondents mean and peak HR level also rises. Significant mean and peak
                    HR were identified at 38°C for all respondents. In addition, respondents become fatigue and
                    sluggish much faster at 38°C compared to 25°C and 34°C. The most notable decline in physical
                    abilities was identified for Respondent A under 38°C setting. One possible reason for this situation
                    is that respondent A Body Mass Index (BMI) is much higher than the two other respondents.",

                    increases the risk of heat stress for Malaysian construction workers who mostly work under the

                    stress at construction site and its impact on work performance. A perception survey through
                    Google Form was distributed to 53 construction workers. Participants that are selected for

                    working experience and have knowledge of heat stress. Descriptive analysis results indicate
                    respondents experience heat stress at construction site. The air temperature and radiant
                    temperature was perceived as hot. The respondent also stated its uncomfortable to touch any

                    within the domain of logistics management. Nonetheless, this investigation is not without its
                    constraints. Initially, the implementation of a questionnaire survey could potentially yield
                    subjectivity and recall bias. Furthermore, the utilization of non-probability sampling technique
                    could impede the degree of representativeness within the sample population. Furthermore, this
                    research centered exclusively on logistics warehouses situated in China, thereby constraining the
                    potential applicability of its conclusions to dissimilar geographical domains and sectors.
                    Subsequent research endeavors ought to assess the aforementioned constraints and delve deeper
                    into additional variables that impact the effectiveness and monetary aspects of logistics
                    warehouses. Moreover, a deeper analysis is imperative pertaining to the efficacious execution of
                    green supply chain management and sustainable development tactics in real-world scenarios,
                    with the objective of enhancing the operational output and ecological stability of logistics depots.

                    management discipline, and it delineates avenues for forthcoming investigations and potential
                    research advancements. By means of ongoing research and practical implementation, the

                    greenhouse gases would lead to greater temperatures as well as changing patterns of rain and
                    snow, both of which will have a momentous impact on the lives of people. This research was
                    conducted with the objectives of determining how residents of northern Nigeria's farming
                    communities felt about the change within climate variation affects, how they reacted to those
                    changes, and what impact those changes had on agricultural output in the region. For the purpose
                    of the study, one hundred residents of Kaduna were selected at random for taking part. In order
                    to learn how the unpredictability of change within climate and the strategies of adaptation impact
                    agricultural production, a descriptive poll was conducted. The findings indicate that greater
                    majority of individuals are aware of the gravity of change within climate and the fact that the
                    majority of the impacts of change within climate on agricultural and livestock output are negative.
                    The majority of individuals believe that the many strategies that have been developed to counter
                    the undesirable effects of change within climate on agricultural output and livestock production
                    are effective, as the findings of the survey demonstrated.",

                        Gunty's debut novel, The Rabit Hutch, is a modern masterpiece. Set in the post-industrial context,
                        the decaying city of Vacca Vale city in Indiana is struggling to deal with the impacts of withdrawal
                        of Zorn Automobile Company. The novel presents glimpses of the lives of people residing in an
                        affordable apartment called La Lapinière or, mostly known as the Rabbit Hutch. Gunty uses her
                        versatile narrative technique here through utilising different styles such as the use of epistles,
                        black and white pictures, along with obituary comments to closely knit the stories. The desire of
                        the central protagonist, Blandine Watkins for achieving spiritual freedom through dreaming for a
                        bodily escape shows the intent of the novelist to sketch spirituality as the method of freeing
                        oneself from worldly suffering. The subplots of different situations of people living in different
                        apartments helped in connecting the larger view for changing scenario due to withdrawal of the
                        automobile company. The theme of loneliness and worldly misery is portrayed through the life of
                        Blandine while indicating her belief on the Catholic mystics to escape from this entrapment. The
                        novel beautifully sketches the journey of the characters from loneliness to spirituality based on
                        imaginary prediction while handling the real-life issues and political unrest encountered by the

                        this perplexed world while facing racism is the focus of this article. This entire aspect has been
                        discussed in the article through the four main phases of her life, which can be said to be the
                        turning point. The first part of her life was of an ordinary Indian girl living with her family members
                        in a reservation shelter with her fellow Indian tribes. The second phase of her life was when the
                        United States Congress passed the bill for removing the tribal status of the Umpqua tribe. The
                        third phase of her life was when the government passed the law to settle those tribes in the Urban
                        areas of the United States, where they were dealing with problems like racism. In the final phase,
                        the real character appeared, where she worked with all the challenges and became successful in
                        her life.",

                    characteristics, only use different brands that make customers cannot clearly determine the

                    around 270-280 baht, making it unable to compete on price with rubber pillows of the injection
                    industry. Therefore, since rubber pillows are sold in the same products, they differ only in price.

                    government policies, such as the implementing policy of Law No. 32 of 2004 concerning Regional
                    Government, in this case, Government Regulation No. 6 of 2008 concerning Guidelines for the
                    Evaluation of Regional Governance. This has become a kind of encouragement for the emergence
                    of government agencies that can serve the people quickly and accurately. In addition, the

                    the Implementation of Regional Government is the spearhead of creating Capacity Building which
                    is applied to all levels of employees within the scope of government agencies, including the
                    implementation of capacity building within the Salatiga City Regional Personnel Agency. It is

                    should be maintained, protected, developed, and preserved and utilized for human welfare.

                "abstract"=>"BIM technology has become trending in the Malaysian construction industry recently; numerous research
                studies identify the lack of professional skills in BIM application as a primary reason for adopting BIM
                in industries. Facing professional skill issues, BIM education is related to cooperation with the industry,
                universities, technical colleges, and communities by practising and specialising in training. This requires
                studying specific issues in BIM implementation among educators in TVET institutions, and coordination
                with industry professionals is necessary to unveil the present status of BIM in each of the professions.
                The Malaysian TVET Institutions are responding to these barriers by implementing BIM to the institution
                with the curriculum design, collaboration extending to multiple professionals in the industries at the same
                time, and providing adequate education and training to their educators. With this objective, a systematic
                literature review was carried out on WOS and SCOPUS guided by the ROSES methodology. Inclusion
                and exclusion criteria were selected based on keywords, abstracts, and the full content of the articles.
                In the end, 14 articles were thoroughly studied, the integration and evaluation methods analysed, and
                results obtained. The analysis shows the empirical evidence to identify the awareness and determine
                the barriers to implementing BIM among educators in Malaysia TVET Institutions. Finally, recommended
                strategies for mitigating barriers to implementing BIM for educators were identified",

                individual during physical activity using machine learning techniques. We collected a dataset that includes
                features such as heart rate, body temperature, and duration of activity. We used various machine learning
                models, including XGBoost, linear regression, SVM and random forest, to predict calorie burn based
                on 15,000 records with seven features. The results indicate that the XGBboost model can accurately
                predict calorie burn with a minimum mean absolute error of calories. This work contributes to the
                growing body of research on using machine learning for health and fitness applications and has potential
                implications for personalized health coaching and wellness tracking. The highest accuracy of training
                and testing is gained by the XGBboost model with 99.67% with mean absolute error is almost 1.48%.",

                safety management system was developed in the 1980s. With the correct SMS deployment, construction
                companies can reduce safety-related difficulties This study assessed the current status of construction
                safety management with the goal of determining the level of implementation of selected construction
                companies with category AAA in Manila, Philippines. Additionally, a survey was done to determine the SMS
                implementation level in terms of lack of control, basic cause, immediate cause, incident, and accident.
                The researcher used the quantitative method of research with the survey questionnaire as the main tool in
                gathering data. Architects, engineers, safety officer and skilled workers were the respondents of the study.
                The gathered data were statistically treated with the used of frequency, percentages, and weighted mean.
                The results of this study are helpful to the industry as well because they can improve
                understanding of SMS among industry professionals and aid in better SMS deployment at work.",

                development and as a driving force for office equipment and the economy of the people in Timor-
                Leste, it is pushed to its absolute limit to meet this demand. With the increase in the operation of the
                electric energy generation unit, the wear and tear of the engine components will increase. So, the need
                for increased engine parts, to prevent failure. To remedy this situation and guarantee the machine’s
                continued peak performance, preventative maintenance is executed. Preventive maintenance (PM) is
                one subfield of maintenance that aims to forestall failures before they manifest. The maintenance,
                production, and management teams will need to work closely together to make PM a success. This article
                is a case study of Electrical Diesel Timor-Leste (EDTL), a firm with two power production facilities located
                in Hera and Betano, and it examines the causes of inefficient PM activity and the ramifications this has
                for the organization.",

                "abstract"=>"The goal of reservoir operation policies is to get the most out of the water that can be stored and delivered
                as a water supply. Water shortages and floods may become more common in Malaysia because of climate
                change and global warming. The biggest impediment to developing reliable water storage and supplies
                in Sg Layang Reservoir, Johor, Malaysia, is a lack of water. Forecasting reservoir water levels is critical for
                storage management, particularly in water supply systems. As a result, the objective of this research is to
                create a reservoir simulation model using the Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) to generate water
                levels to compare with observed water levels and to predict water levels using input variables such as
                future daily rainfall to examine the reservoir’s performance under changing conditions. Rainfall data from
                2011 is utilized to calibrate the system, while data from 2012 to 2013 is used to validate it. The observed
                rainfall data was applied to the Sungai Layang watershed region. The correlation coefficient, R2, was
                employed to show the watershed’s best value. The calibration procedure has an R2 of 0.91, whereas the
                validation procedure has an R2 of 0.88. The accuracy of the model is satisfactory, as the R2 is near to 1.0,
                and calibration parameters can be employed in the following design processes, according to the analysis
                completed by HEC-HMS applications. The simulation was carried out using the same parameters in 2017,
                2030, and 2050 with four distinct scenarios to evaluate water level behavior using future rainfall data.
                According to the simulation, most of the water level in the future will be below the crucial threshold of 23.5m.
                The findings reveal that climate change has an impact on reservoir functioning in terms of rainfall intensity.",

                tion of big data analytics to forecast the forest fire incident in Peninsular Malaysia.
                Design/methodology/approach – The research project has developed a Forest Fire Incident Forecast-
                ing System in Permanent Reserves Forest (PRF) to forecast forest fire incidence in Peninsular Malaysia. This
                project was conducted for the Forestry Department Peninsular Malaysia (JPSM) in collaboration with the
                Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC) using Big Data Analytics (BDA).
                Findings – The results from the system have been summarized into four conclusions. Firstly, the forecast of
                areas with fire potential can be identified as early as 7 days; secondly, the location of relevant agencies to deal
                with forest fires close to the site of the fire incident can be identified. Third, the water source close to the fire scene
                can be located; and finally, the estimated cost of the extinguishing operation can be determined in advance.
                Practical Implications - To overcome these obstacles and accomplish wise for-
                est management, modern science, and technology must be improved. This research proj-
                ect has successfully implemented BDA via the Forest Fire Incident Forecasting System
                in PRF. It has improved the performance of the JPSM for its forest management system.
                Originality – The project is originally conducted with collaborations between the JPSM and NRECC in
                the Malaysian federal government and has been successfully implemented by the forestry department.",

                    and the people’s livelihood had drastically fallen as the virus hindered the logistics, sales, and produc-
                    tion efforts of the region. Capiz State University implemented the RISE Capiz (Riverine Improvement
                    towards a Sustainable Ecotourism in Roxas City, Capiz) Program to address the gaps, challenges, and
                    needs of the riverine communities within Roxas City, Capiz, Philippines. It aimed to establish a sus-
                    tainable ecotourism industry in the riverine communities. This study involved a mixed-methods ap-
                    proach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative component utilized a
                    citizen-centric community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) approach, ensuring river tour
                    members’ active participation in the research process. The results indicate that the trainings were
                    well received and have produced tangible outcomes in terms of increased income and improved live-
                    lihoods. The implementation of the acquired knowledge and skills has not only benefited the riverine
                    communities, but also played a role in preserving the riverine communities. It is the hope that the
                    impact of these trainings will be long-lasting and continue to provide benefits to the riverine com-
                    munities in the future. The utilization of social media pages, as a tool for promoting RISE Capiz’s Pa-
                    lina and Cadimahan river tour operators and their offerings, was found to be an effective strategy.",

                of rice straw as affected by the number of days of exposure to the field prior to processing. A total of 24
                packs of rice straw samples collected at 1 day after threshing (DAT), 4 DAT, and 7 DAT field exposure un-
                treated and treated with urea for 10 days were analyzed for its chemical changes using proximate anal-
                ysis and surface structure of the fiber compounds through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results
                (%DM basis) showed that 1DAT untreated rice straw obtained the highest dry matter (DM) concentration
                at 94.61%. Seven DAT untreated rice straw contain the highest amount of Ash at 20.92%. Likewise, 1
                DAT and 7 DAT untreated rice straw contains higher levels of crude protein (CP) at 9.60% and 9.79%, re-
                spectively. Ether extract (EE) was observed highest in 1DAT untreated rice straw at 1.97%. Considerable
                breakdown of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin fractions of rice straw was attained in 4DAT and 7DAT
                untreated, and 1 to 7 DAT urea-treated rice straw (UTRS) as evident by its lower NDF, ADF, and ADL values.
                Changes in the surface structures of microfibers efficiently captured using SEM showed the differences
                in the morphology of the fibers as influenced by number of days exposed to the field prior to treatment.
                Therefore, in order to optimize the protocol to improve the feeding and nutritional quality of rice straw, it
                is suggested that the number of days of exposure to the field be considered prior to processing. Likewise,
                UTRS is an effective method to disintegrate the complex fibrous compounds of the cell wall of rice straw.",

                low-dose estrogen preparate (25 mg MPA and 5 mg estradiol cipionate) is commonly used in Indonesia.
                It is less practical, because the subjects must visit health services every month. To reduce the imprac-
                ticality, it has been developed a bi-monthly contraceptive injection of 65 mg MPA and 7.5mg estradi-
                ol cypionate and a trimonthly contraceptive injection of 120 mg MPA and 10 mg estradiol cypionate.
                Method: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial - open-label conducted from March 2013
                to May 2017 with a total sample of 1080. The study subjects consist of 3 groups. The first group
                was treated with bi-monthly injections (Injection A), the second group was treated with trimonth-
                ly injections (Injection B) and the third group was treated with monthly injections (Injection C). The
                blood pressure, pulse rate and body weight were measured since initial treatment and during each
                visit for 1 year of treatment. This clinical trial has been registered in the National Agency of Drug
                and Food Control of the Republic of Indonesia with clinical trial number: PN.01.02.1.31.10.12.6669
                Result: No significant differences of blood pressure between each group and during 1 year of in-
                jection in each group. We found significant differences of weight gain in each group during
                1 year of injection (p<0.01), but we did not find significant difference of weight gain be-
                tween each group. Injection B shows the lowest percentage of dropout cases (1,21%).
                Conclusion: It can be concluded that bi-monthly injections and trimonth-
                ly injections are more effective than monthly injections for 12 months of use. They
                are safe to use, convenient in reducing doctor visits and have a high acceptability.",

                "abstract"=>"This abstract summarises the studies on the use of umbilical cord stem cells to treat Prader-Willi syn-
                drome. Among the various stem cells found in the umbilical cord, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem
                cells may create bioactive molecules that aid in tissue repair and regeneration, control immunological
                responses, and give birth to a variety of cell types. Because of this, they present a feasible option for
                treating the multidisciplinary character of PWS. Preclinical research on PWS animal models has shown
                promising outcomes, with umbilical cord stem cell transplantation improving metabolic disorders, hy-
                pothalamic function, and general behavior. It has been investigated if immunological regulation, trophic
                support, and paracrine signaling are among the factors that promote stem cell therapeutic potential.
                Several clinical studies employing umbilical cord stem cells to treat PWS are now underway, and the
                findings should aid in assessing the advantages and disadvantages of using this approach on patients.
                The preliminary evidence is encouraging, since some trial participants improved in hyperphagia, mus-
                cular tone, and cognitive ability. Although the use of umbilical cord stem cells as a PWS treatment
                has shown some promise, further study is required to determine its long-term safety, optimal dose,
                and ongoing effectiveness. A variety of key elements, such as ethical issues, regulatory frameworks,
                and the availability of standardized stem cell products, will have a considerable impact on the future
                development of this treatment technique. SD is a disease known as a neurodevelopmental problem
                represented through problems with social communication, sensor sensitivity, and repetitive behaviors.
                Despite years of study, therapy options for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain relatively limited.
                As regenerative medicine has improved, stem cell treatment has been investigated as a novel thera-
                peutic option for the underlying neurological disorders that underpin ASD. The development, possible
                methods, and potential uses of stem cell treatment for autistic children are discussed in this article.",

                stem cells may be employed to regenerate neurons and repair damaged ones. Several animal studies
                have shown that stem cell treatment can reduce autistic-like behaviour. One study indicated that stem
                cell treatment helped autistic rodents engage in less repetitive activity and have more positive social
                interactions. The outcomes of the first human clinical studies were likewise promising. One study found
                that teenagers on the autism spectrum were able to communicate better after receiving stem cell treat-
                ment. It’s important to remember, though, that studies of stem cell treatment for ASD are just getting
                started. More studies on the efficacy and safety of stem cell treatment in people are needed. Ethical
                considerations must also be considered before stem cell treatment is extensively employed to treat ASD.",

                the bottom” expressed by Robert Feynman until its reality appeared in the form of technology called
                nanotechnology, which has left its footprints in almost every field of science and technology. Nano-
                technology is based on two approaches i.e. Top-Down Approach and Bottom-up Approach. These two
                approaches include different physical, chemical and biological methods for the production of materi-
                als at Nano scale. Biological method especially use of plant parts (green method) is strongly rec-
                ommended nowadays due its unique features i.e. simplicity, biocompatibility, cost-effectiveness and
                eco-friendliness. In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles through green method
                by using Mulberry leaves. The green synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by techniques
                such as Uv-visible spectrophotometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Dynamic light scattering, Fourier
                transformer-infrared, X-ray Diffraction. The nanoparticles were studied for their different activities i.e.
                antimicrobial activity, antidiabetic activity, antioxidant activity, catalytic activity and cytotoxic activity.",

                Researchers have developed a large number of different methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles;
                among this green route method is of great importance as it is eco-friendly and cost-effective. In this
                study we synthesized copper nanoparticles through green synthesis using a plant called lagerstroemia
                speciose. The formation of copper nanoparticles has been observed due to change in colour of extract
                solution. The sample solution was characterized by different techniques in order to find out the various
                physiological parameters like shape, size and nature of bonding. Plant extract acts as both reducing
                and capping agent .The various instruments used for characterization are DLS (Dynamic Light Scat-
                tering), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), X-ray Diffractometry (XRD) and Fourier Transform-In-
                frared (FT-IR). Cups obtained were of size 35nm. The synthesized copper nanoparticles were stud-
                ied for their anti-microbial activity, antioxidant, antidiabetic and catalytic activities and cytotoxicity.",

                students transitioning from online to offline education following the COVID-19 pandemic. The abrupt tran-
                sition from online to offline education has presented significant obstacles for students, negatively affecting
                their academic performance and mental health. This study seeks to comprehend the factors influencing
                academic stress during the transition, the challenges of readjustment encountered by students returning
                to offline education, and the potential benefits of this change. In addition, the function of optimism as
                a coping mechanism and its impact on academic stress and mental health will be investigated. This in-
                vestigation will be conducted using a secondary research methodology. The existing literature, including
                research articles, journals, and other pertinent sources published after 2015, will be analysed critically to
                glean useful insights. The research will examine previous studies examining the connection between aca-
                demic stress and mental health, the impact of optimism on contending with academic stress, and the ef-
                fects of the transition from online to offline education on mental health. To provide a comprehensive com-
                prehension of the factors at play, theoretical frameworks such as stress and coping theories will be utilised.",

                of students and employees about Advance First-Aid, and know the views of respondents on life-saving
                skills. Utilizing the descriptive research method, the study was limited to 25 employees composed of faculty
                and non-teaching staff, and 120 students from the six departments of CAPSU Pilar last July-October of
                2019. Purposive random sampling was used in the identification and selection of the respondents for the
                students and employees. A modified questionnaire was made, pre-tested, and subjected for validity and
                reliability. The statistical tools used in the study were standard deviation, frequency counts, percentage,
                and mean. The majority of the employees and students were non-knowledgeable about basic first-aid.
                All employees and students were non-knowledgeable about advanced first aid. Employees and students
                strongly agreed with their views on life-saving skills. People empowerment in life-saving skills is a great
                factor in helping save lives. Hence, skills training was introduced on the campus to equip the employees
                and students with life-saving skills that would serve as their best weapon for life. With life-saving skills,
                the call for social responsibility becomes evident through the principle of volunteerism and immediate
                response to any circumstance confronting health.",

                pines, the ASEAN region, and the rest of the world. This descriptive-qualitative inquiry sought to uncover
                the COVID-19 constructs of college students and to determine new normal learning delivery modalities
                in the context of a state-owned higher education institution. Anchored on the constructivist lens and the
                grounded theory, Ricoeur’s hermeneutic analysis served as a method of exploring the narratives. The
                perceived effects of the community quarantines were modes of schooling changed, mental health was
                tested, internet connectivity problems, economic impacts, and boredom. To better respond to the pan-
                demic, the participants believed that the higher education institution may listen to all stakeholders, learn
                from other universities, and formulate research-based actions. Modular and online modes wherein blend-
                ed learning synchronously and asynchronously served as the operational learning delivery modalities
                of the higher education institution. The learning delivery modalities of the higher education institution
                complied with the policies and guidelines of the national government, local government units, and the
                Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. The new normal learning
                delivery modalities in a higher education institution based on the constructs of the COVID-19 pandemic
                of college students were formulated. The results of this study may serve as bases for developing partici-
                patory and proactive educational policies and guidelines in transitioning from normal to the new normal.",

                communication in a glocal society in a Philippine graduate school classroom. Virtual interviews were
                done with the participants. In vivo coding technique and narrative discourse analysis were used for data
                analysis. Results revealed seven emerging discourses on science communication in a graduate school
                classroom. These are 1) popularizing research- and evidenced-based knowledge, 2) focusing on truth
                and authenticity, 3) synergy of thinking skills, 4) social media engagement, 5) science communication in
                policymaking, 6) emancipation and empowerment through education, and peace and global understanding.
                The emerging discourses of Filipino graduate students reflect how they perceive science communication
                when positioned globally and applied locally. Science communication is a conduit for making science
                relevant and impactful to all social contexts through sound and accurate knowledge sharing and
                engagement of scientific and technical information. Integrating it into allied disciplines to maximize its
                practical application may emphasize science communication in an academic setting. Future researchers
                may replicate this study by exploring other methodologies and collaborating with international partner
                educational institutions to look into intercultural and cross-cultural constructs along this research interest.",

                that most of them were aged between 15-19 years old, had graduated from public schools, had at least
                2 varieties of reading materials at home, and their parents had educational attainment of high school.
                Moreover, the results of the WAT revealed that showing one’s writing to others was ranked first among
                the factors of writing apprehension. However, the results of the WAT also demonstrated that students
                did not experience a significantly unusual level of writing apprehension. The demographic profile of the
                respondents (age, type of school last attended, variety of reading materials at home, and educational at-
                tainment of the parents) also had no significant effect on their level of writing apprehension. These results
                are in line with the literature and discussions. Therefore, the study recommends some strategies to reduce
                students” writing apprehension and enhance their writing performance.",

                2023 as input for a speech enhancement program and innovations. Specifically, attempts to deter-
                mine the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents in terms of gender, age, high school type
                graduated, parents’ educational attainment, employment status, and estimated monthly income; de-
                termine speech profile in terms of Vocal Mechanism and Diction; identify their strengths and weak-
                nesses in speech production; determine the significant relationship between speech profile and so-
                cio-demographic characteristics; and determine whether speech enhancement program or innovations
                may be introduced to improve weaknesses in speech production. A descriptive survey research de-
                sign was used to gather information on the basic and speech profiles of 40 respondents. Results re-
                vealed, that respondents were generally female, 20-22 years old, graduated from public senior high
                school, with high school graduate parents, unemployed, and earned PhP 4,000- PhP8,000. Results
                showed that respondents were very strong in loudness, articulation, pronunciation, and even in read-
                ing rate. However, a closer examination of the data reveals that at least one-third were slow readers.
                Furthermore, an analysis revealed that females have louder voices than males, demonstrating a sub-
                stantial relationship between gender and loudness of voice. As evidenced by the extremely signifi-
                cant relationship between rate and gender, females read faster than males. Results also showed that
                those with working moms could talk more articulately than those with jobless mothers. Finally, re-
                sults demonstrated that pronunciation is unrelated to any demographic characteristics. A suitable
                speech enhancement program/innovation was designed to improve proficiency in speech production.",

                Papua is renowned for its unspoiled natural landscapes, diverse ecosystems, and vibrant indigenous
                traditions. Nevertheless, it grapples with challenges concerning economic advancement, infrastructural
                development, and ecological sustainability. The adoption of sustainable tourism emerges as a promising
                avenue for addressing these issues, given its core principles of safeguarding the environment, preserving
                indigenous cultures, and enhancing community welfare. The study’s objectives encompass an assessment
                of the opportunities and hurdles associated with sustainable tourism in West Papua, an exploration
                of how local culture influences tourist attraction and cultural preservation, an examination of global
                best practices in sustainable tourism, an evaluation of the region’s potential for eco-friendly tourism
                investments, and the provision of strategic policy recommendations for relevant stakeholders. The
                research methodology relies on secondary data sources, including scholarly articles, reports, and case
                studies. The analysis places emphasis on the economic, environmental, social, and cultural dimensions
                of sustainable tourism in the context of West Papua. Ultimately, the report concludes by furnishing
                guidance for bolstering sustainable tourism policies, enhancing infrastructure, encouraging further
                research, and cultivating an inviting atmosphere for investments in sustainable tourism within West Papua.",

                in the neighborhood. Income generation, employment opportunities, and economic diversity were
                identified as key elements in community development. The findings lend credence to the notion that
                promoting tourism might help alleviate poverty and improve the standard of living for locals. It is
                critical to preserve and promote cultural traditions and heritage in order to attract tourists and im-
                prove the overall tourism experience. Authentic cultural experiences, such as traditional customs,

                attributes to develop a School Transformation Model for Augustinian Recollect schools in the Philippines,
                utilizing the pedagogy of St. Augustine and the axiomatic theory fusion as theoretical frameworks.
                Using a mixed-methods approach that includes both Focused Group Discussions with administrators,
                teachers, and students and a survey of 300 students, the study found that the Filipino Whole Learn-
                er can be successfully integrated into the Augustinian Recollect learner attributes, which emphasiz-
                es a values-oriented approach to education. Proper implementation is necessary to ensure that the
                programs align with the intended practices of the attributes, as defined by the Augustinian Recollect
                education system. The study suggests that the Augustinian Recollect Whole Learner framework can
                serve as a school transformation model for other Filipino schools. The framework prioritizes a holis-
                tic approach to education and the development of interiority, innovation, inclusion, instruction, and
                involvement in learners. By utilizing the axiomatic theory fusion as a method for merging different
                knowledge and entities, the Filipino Whole Learner practices and implementation can be seamlessly
                integrated into the existing system. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into developing a
                learner-centered approach to education in the context of Philippine schools facing constant challeng-
                es and changes, using the pedagogy of St. Augustine and axiomatic theory fusion as a strong the-
                oretical foundation that takes into account the unique needs and characteristics of Filipino learners.",

                long time, the concept of cultural diplomacy is still developing; that is, experts in this field continue to con-
                tribute to the improvement of the development of the concept. This study intends to add four objectives of
                cultural diplomacy based on testimonials of 52 Indonesian Arts and Culture Scholarship alumni in a book
                entitled 15 Years Indonesian Art and Culture Scholarship. Based on the responses of 52 Indonesian Arts
                and Culture Scholarship (IACS) alumni, we received and coded 292 citations and produced 10 themes re-
                lated to cultural diplomacy in the IACS. Out of the 10 themes, we further set 10 cultural diplomacy goals,
                out of which 6 are aligned with the goals for cultural diplomacy set by an expert. However, we found four
                new interesting objectives that can benefit the country if used to their full potential. It is incredible to know
                that pure arts and cultural activities can produce various feelings that indicate the possibility of soft power.",

                proved, and effecti eness has gone up. But there isn’t much study on how Lean Six Sigma could
                be used in the transportation industry. Because the transportation industry is so intricate and ev-
                er-changing, it must have procedures that are both efficien and effecti e in order to guarantee that
                both people and goods will be transported in a secure manner and on time. Over the past few years,
                companies in the transportation industry have been looking for ways to improve the quality and effi-
                ciency of their processes, which has led to an uptick in interest in the application of Lean Six Sigma",

                concepts in their organizations, encountered barriers, levels of awareness and understanding, imple-
                mented circular practices, perceived benefits, the importance of sustainability, financial or operational
                challenges, motivators for embracing circular economy, and the accessibility of support and resources.
                The findings indicate that participants have an average degree of awareness regarding circular economy
                concepts. While some organizations have completely or partially implemented circular economy principles,
                a significant portion has not yet integrated them, suggesting a need for more initiatives. Financial limita-
                tions, supply chain restrictions, and a lack of knowledge are the primary barriers to adoption. Employee
                knowledge and comprehension of circular economy concepts have room for improvement. Commonly
                implemented circular practices include renewable energy use, material recycling, and product lifespan
                extension. Perceived benefits include cost savings, resource conservation, and increased stakeholder
                participation. Sustainability may not be considered important in overall strategy and decision-making
                by a majority of participants. Financial or operational difficulties are experienced by some organizations
                during the adoption of circular economy principles. Motivators for embracing circular economy include cost
                savings, brand reputation, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder expectations. Participants highlight a
                need for more support and resources to implement circular economy projects. Overall, the survey high-
                lights the varying levels of familiarity, integration, challenges, awareness, and understanding of circular
                economy concepts among participants, and underscores the importance of addressing barriers, raising
                awareness, and providing sufficient support and resources for advancing circular economy principles.",

                "abstract"=>"3d printing has its advantages and wonders, but this technology also has its dark side. Sometimes, the
                object will simply be a copy of an existing commercial product. Likewise, there are few reports on the
                ethical considerations regarding 3d printing, especially in the Philippines where piracy or illegal copying
                is rampant. Thus, the ethical perspective of this venture was taken into consideration. Integrative review
                combining meta-analysis and synthesis as a research design for this study was facilitated through a liter -
                ature and study review using PRISMA. Studies on the ethical perspectives of 3D printing were searched
                through the electronic databases ProQuest, Elsevier, CINAHL, PubMed, Medline Plus, and Ebsco. The
                search for studies harvested 186 articles of which were searched through the mentioned databases. Out
                of these articles, 62 studies met the inclusion criteria. The data provided by these studies were compiled,
                organized by themes noting similarities and differences. After a more and thorough review, 8 studies ex-
                actly and completely fit all the protocols and findings needed to be included in this study. Findings revealed
                issues on the protocol development in the ethical conduct of 3D printing in particular to prototyping and
                rapid manufacturing; research on the ethical conduct of 3D printing are also lacking and post-evaluation
                on the conduct of 3D printing as applied to the its purpose were not considered in the existing laws and
                regulations. All the 8 studies on the ethical perspective on 3D printing are unique in their methods, sam -
                pling, data treatment, results and more importantly, findings but their focus is shared. More so, the study
                suggests further looking at the impact of certain amendments on the laws and policies in 3D printing to
                its ethics components and relating this to policy formulation that protects all stakeholders’ interests in
                this emerging technological industry. Users and manufacturers of 3D printers and 3D printed objects will
                encounter issues involving patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other IP rights is a reality in the future.

                household heads of the municipality of Pontevedra during COVID-19 pandemic. A random sample of
                372 household heads in a total of 12,071 households (PHO, 2021) in the municipality served as re-
                spondents of the study. A validated and pilot-tested researcher-made questionnaire was used as re-
                search instrument distributed using both online platform (Google Forms) and in printed questionnaire.
                Findings indicate that household heads in the municipality of Pontevedra are mostly females,
                in their mid-forties, married, Roman Catholic, College graduate, headed a household of fi e with a
                family member of less than 5 years old and a senior citizen, unemployed, with family monthly in-
                come below the poverty line, no medical insurance and stayed in the place for a quarter of a cen-
                tury. Majority of the HH heads have not been tested for COVID-19, has not been diagnosed by
                health care professionals based on symptoms only, had no in-person contact with anyone infect-
                ed with COVID-19; and majority of them have no comorbidities or pre-existing health conditions.
                Moreover, HH heads are aware that they are quite unlikely to get COVID-19 and very close-
                ly complied about guidelines for COVID-19. Most of the HH heads in Pontevedra are COVID-19
                Vaccine Confident, have a high level of social cohesion and trust during COVID-19, somewhat sat-
                isfied with the COVID-19 Control, and somewhat agree to receive COVID-19 Vaccination.
                There are significant differences on the mean vaccine confidence scores when HH heads
                are classified according to their age, highest educational attainment, employment sta-
                tus, and family monthly income. COVID-19 Vaccination response of HH Heads was significan -

                their level of social cohesion and trust, and their level of satisfaction with the COVID-19 control.

                "abstract"=>"This study primarily aimed to analyze the discourse competence of teachers
                in English as Second Language (ESL) classrooms in the Biliran Division.
                Employing the mixed-methods research design, this research elicited data from the 20 secondary teachers
                in English as Second Language (ESL) classrooms in Biliran Division during the school year 2021-2022.
                The findings reveal that the most common cohesive ties used by the English teachers were: reference
                (rephrasing, restatement); ellipsis (omission of word/s); substitution (the use of one);
                discourse markers (the use of alright, so, okay); and discourse connectives (the use of so).
                Moreover, the syntactic errors committed by English teachers in Biliran Division are mostly
                on subject-verb agreement, use of prepositions, code-switching, pronunciation, and plurality.
                Based on the overall observation and analysis of the participants’ utterances, the researcher concluded
                that the teachers in English as a Second Language (ESL) Classrooms in Biliran Division used
                linguistic features as their immediate recourse in times of vocabulary loss and grammar confusion.
                In line with this, the school administrators may invest and strengthen the language
                learning development programs for ESL teachers because it is through
                them that the schools train and develop the minds of the next generation.",

                instruction on pupil’s numeracy skills. The objective is to determine if there are significant differences
                in posttest gains between a control group taught in the mother tongue (Tagalog) and an experimental
                group taught in English. The researcher also aims to identify the factors and challenges faced by teachers
                using both languages as mediums of instruction. Using a mixed-method design, the researcher collected
                quantitative and qualitative data. Sixty pupils each were randomly selected for the control and
                experimental groups from Laiya Elementary School. Pretest and posttest scores were analyzed for the
                120 Grade 3 pupils. The results revealed that the experimental group taught in English achieved significantly
                higher posttest results compared to the control group taught in the mother tongue. Qualitative
                data was obtained through interviews with Grade 3 and Grade 4 teachers, highlighting factors such as
                poor study habits, lack of interest and motivation, limited parental involvement, and low reading comprehension
                levels as barriers to improving numeracy skills. Furthermore, teachers faced challenges when
                using both languages, with Grade 3 teachers struggling to translate mathematical terms into the mother
                tongue and Grade 4 teachers finding it difficul to assess pupils’ prior knowledge due to their strong
                exposure to the mother tongue. Transitioning between languages, especially in the first quarter, created
                confusion and hesitation among pupils. Limited English vocabulary acquired during primary years further
                hindered understanding and comprehension. To enhance numeracy skills, teachers emphasized the need
                for motivation, additional activities, integration of numeracy across subjects, improved reading comprehension,
                parental participation, varied teaching methods, and a conducive learning environment. The
                study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate language, establishing a language-rich environment,
                incorporating cultural relevance, and integrating language and mathematics instruction to foster
                deep understanding, critical thinking skills, and confidence in students as proficient mathematicians.",

                State University-Laboratory High School (BiPSU-LHS) in their written discourse, SY: 2021-2022. Utilizing
                the descriptive-correlational research design, this study elicited data from the 33 students of BiPSU-LHS.
                Findings revealed that most Grade 11 Senior High School students in BiPSU-LHS spent 1-3 hours in
                watching English Videos per week. On the other hand, most of the Grade 11 Senior High School students
                in BiPSU-LHS only spent 15 minutes to 1 hour in reading English materials per week. Moreover,
                the most common syntactic error committed by the Grade 11 students in the written discourse
                was the use of ‘wrong or missing prepositions; most common morphological error committed
                by the Grade 11 students in the written discourse was the use of ‘contraction;’ and most common
                technical errors committed by the Grade 11 students in the written discourse was poor punctuation.
                Hence, there is a significant relationship between the profile of the Grade 11 Senior High
                School students and their syntactic errors, morphological errors, and technical errors committed.
                Based on the overall observation and analysis of the data gathered, the researcher concluded that
                the Grade 11 students in Biliran Division during the school year 2021-2022 have committed linguistic
                errors in their written discourse, such as: syntactic, morphological, and technical categories.",

                This study explores the effectiveness of distance learning compared to on-site learning in the context of
                pre-medical course students (grade 12). The research investigates students from the math science class and
                utilizes an online questionnaire in conjunction with the final results of the Thai Professional Aptitude Test (TPAT).
                Crucially, the research reveals that distance learning students tend to outperform their on-site counterparts
                in TPAT exams, although the difference is not overwhelmingly significant. This study contributes
                valuable insights into the growing impact of distance learning and its potential benefits for
                pre-medical course students. Further research and analysis in this domain could provide educators
                and institutions with valuable guidelines for optimizing educational approaches in the digital era.",

                a quasi-experimental design wherein the experimental group was exposed to learning activities through
                the KWDL technique combined with BAR model while the control group learned through traditional.
                The sample used in this research was 38 Secondary 1 (Grade 7) students from Rizal National
                Science High School, Rizal Province, Philippines, who studied in the second semester of
                the 2022 academic year by cluster sampling. The research instruments consisted of 1) learning
                management plans with learning activities through traditional; 2) learning management
                plans with learning activities through the KWDL technique combined with the BAR model; 3) problem-
                solving ability in a Math test. Data analysis included mean, standard deviation, and t-test
                The results showed that: 1) the problem-solving ability in Math of Secondary 1 (Grade 7) students
                after studying learning activities through the KWDL technique combined with the BAR model was
                higher than before learning at a statistical significance level of .05 level; 2) the problem-solving ability in
                Math of Secondary 1 (Grade 7) students after studying learning activities through traditional was higher
                than before learning at a statistical significance level of .05; 3) the problem-solving ability in Math of
                Secondary 1 (Grade 7) students studying learning activities through KWDL technique combined with BAR
                model was higher than the learning activities through traditional at statistical significance level of .05.",

        //         arts of the river folks in Capiz, Philippines. Specifically, the study aimed to (1) determine the literary aes-
        //         thetics of verbal arts in terms of its denotation, connotation, diction, rhetorical devices, metrical devices,
        //         musical devices, tone, and structure; and (2) unearth the Filipino worldviews reflected in the narratives
        //         of the ballad. Results showed that the riverine community, particularly the river folks, has vibrant verbal
        //         arts, such as the ballad. They compose these verbal arts from their memory which they learn from the past

        //         plicitly reflected. Hence, these verbal arts shall be passed on to the next generations, for it tells both their

                for creating a mentorship program at the Department of Education in the Schools Division of Capiz specifically
                in the Districts of Tapaz East and West. The study looks at the respondents’ sociodemographic
                characteristics, amount of involvement in the study, and difficulties experienced in both qualitative and
                quantitative research. Data were gathered using a researcher-made questionnaire and a descriptive study
                approach. One hundred permanently hired teachers from the Tapaz East and Tapaz West Districts of the
                Capiz Schools Division were among the respondents; they were chosen by purposive sampling. The results
                show that many instructors showed a high degree of research involvement, demonstrating their dedication
                to professional growth. However, students also had to deal with a number of difficulties, including an
                increased workload, a loss of free time, writing anxiety, and a lack of resources and help from the school.
                A mentorship program that focuses on efficient task management, time allocation for research, writing
                support, school support, research training, cooperation and networking, as well as assessment and feedback,
                is advised to solve these issues. The quality of education may be improved by the Department of
                Education by adopting this mentorship program and encouraging a research culture among teachers.
                The study’s conclusions and suggestions add to the body of information on instructors who engage in research
                and give other educational institutions advice on how to set up successful mentorship programs.",

                system. It may be used to gauge public interest in and preference for various forms of transportation.
                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of how and why consumers pick certain automobiles,
                motorcycles, and public transportation options. The study also hopes to learn why individuals
                prefer using the bus or train instead of driving themselves. Several variables influencing the selection
                of a mode were analyzed, and primary and secondary data were obtained to do so. The city of Makassar
                was surveyed in order to get primary data. Examining how government workers in Makassar get
                to and from work is the focus of this research. Using the Stated Preference method, 352 participants
                from various government agencies were surveyed and split into two groups. Multinomial logistic analysis
                was conducted using statistical testing and the STATA statistical program. The estimate of the
                quantitative model takes into account two sets of variables: personal traits and trip features. According
                to the results, this form of transportation has more value and likelihood of use than other modes.",

                forwarding organizations, with the prime emphasis on the interplay between Incoterms, overall competitiveness
                and relational resources. The globalized economy’s reliance on international trade helps
                in taking the efficient movement of goods essential, with freight forwarders playing the essential
                role. The study’s objectives integrates viewing the effects of Incoterms selection and viewing interaction
                between relational and incoterms resources. Mainly this research highlights the relatively understudied
                area, delivering the valuable insights for both business community and academia. By
                means of mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, the
                aim of the research is offering the comprehensive comprehending that in what way strategic decisions
                regarding Incoterms and the cultivation of relational resources aids in contributing the sustainable
                competitive advantage with respect to Indonesian freight forwarding. The findings are anticipated

                of caring and resiliency. Their nursing philosophy of caring and resiliency tested their leadership
                abilities and the scope of their governance in managing their clinical units. Nurses are becoming sick
                and resulting positive with rapid test kits on the disease. Others are resigning from their posts to
                protect their families and significant others. The nursing shortage is becoming evident and being felt
                by nurse leaders. Their leadership and governance were caught unaware of the existence of these
                global disease outbreaks, leading to countless works and untiring delivery of holistic care among patients
                with COVID-19 cases. As regards, the paper focuses on the construct of emerging theory in
                caring and resiliency among nurse leaders holding the highest position in the nursing service, meeting
                a lot of challenges in the new normal of their praxis on nursing management during the pandemic

                their psychological well-being are at risk while burnout and compassion fatigue are at stake to be observed.
                It is high time for nurse leaders to revisit their leadership and management programs to ensure
                that they are creating a cross-cultural environment where nurses foster holistic caring and resiliency.",

                Since the 1950s, extreme precipitation frequency has increased and produced more rain in many parts
                of the world. The threat of flooding is the most immediate effect of heavy rain. This danger is magnified
                in cities, where impermeable pavements compel water to flow swiftly into sewer systems. In this study,
                the extreme value Type 1 (Gumbel), Normal, and Log-Pearson Type III probability distributions have
                been utilized to perform flood frequency analysis on the peak annual series discharge data of 16 stations
                at Johor state for the water years 2010 to 2020. The predicted design floods for the return periods of 2
                years, 5 years, 10 years,50 years, 100 years, and 1000 years were obtained and compared. Our results
                indicate that the Gumbel type 3 distribution predicted larger discharge values in most of the stations.",

         "abstract"=>"This research aims to take into account the association between inflation and oil prices within an oil-dependent
         economy. Oil is considered as one of the essential commodities in the world, and its price
         has a significant influence on the global economy. Moreover, the oil-dependent economies are heavily
         based on oil exports for their economic growth, which makes them vulnerable to fluctuation in
         oil prices. Hence to understand the relationship between variables the research applied panel data
         analysis of different oil-dependent economies for the duration of 20 years (2000 to 2020). The result
         found a significant and strong correlation amid the upsurge in inflation rate and oil price. This shows
         that a positive relationship is present amid the dependent and independent variable. The findings revealed
         that 10% rise in oil prices mainly causes an average increase of 0.5% inflation in economies.
         The study recommends that oil price has a positive influence in oil-dependent economies and policymakers
         should take this relationship in their consideration while establishing the monetary policies.",

 "abstract"=>"This study aims to determine the independent variables that are able to predict dividend payment behavior
 and prove the occurrence of dividend catering theory in manufacturing companies that are in
 the growth phase. In determining the research sample, the researcher used purposive sampling. The
 number of samples in this study were 7 manufacturing companies with a total of 92 observations during
 2015 – 2019. This study uses multinomial logistic regression analysis on SPSS 25. The results show
 that the dividend premium and profitability variables get positive and significant values in the high dividend
 payout model. as well as low dividend payout models. While the firm size variable gets a positive
 and significant value in the high dividend payout model, it does not get a significant value in the low
 dividend payout model. This means that in the high dividend payout model, the variables of premium
 dividends, profitability, and firm size are able to predict the behavior of dividend payments in manufacturing
 companies that are in the growth phase. However, in the low dividend payout model, only the
 dividend premium and profitability variables are able to predict the behavior of dividend payments in
 manufacturing companies that are in the growth phase. The results also prove that the dividend catering
 theory is proven to occur in manufacturing companies that are in the growth phase of 2015 – 2019.",

 "abstract"=>"The world economy has been experiencing two double difficulties, including the COVID-19 pandemic
 and the war of Russia and Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine war, accompanied by strong Western economic
 sanctions as well as Russia’s reactions, has had a comprehensive and profound negative impact on the
 world economy. With the openness of the economy as high as it is today, the influence between different
 economies is understandable. The research results focus on analyzing the financial contagion between
 mature and emerging markets in the post-COVID pandemic and the war of Russia and Ukraine. The
 study collected random stock index data from 5 developed and 5 developing countries from 2015 to
 the end of January 2023. The study uses the GARCH(1,1)-M model to find the financial spread between
 selected countries. Research results show that developed countries have a larger financial spread than
 developing countries, especially during the post-COVID pandemic and the war of Russia - Ukraine period.",

 "abstract"=>"This research highlights the importance of effective speech writing across diverse fields, recognizing challenges
 posed by our ever-changing technological landscape. Research introduce the Learning Appreciation
 by Innovation (L.A.B.I.) Model is a groundbreaking framework that aims to transform speech writing. This
 research model blends traditional principles with cutting-edge technology, empowering speechwriters at
 all levels and fostering both technical expertise and a profound appreciation for the art of speechwriting.
 Within the literature review chapter, there is a detailed exploration of existing theories, models, and
 research related to speech composition, communication art, educational innovation, and technology.
 Research emphasizes the intersection of artistry and craftsmanship in speech writing, the evolving landscape
 of speech composition in the digital era, and the potential of innovation in education. The review
 leads to the introduction of the L.A.B.I. Model as a visionary framework that bridges traditional teaching
 methods with the demands of modern communication. The research methodology chapter outlines our
 research approach, focusing on secondary research through academic journals, books, and online databases.
 Research details the search strategy, data sources, extraction process, and ethical considerations,
 establishing a strong foundation for the subsequent literature review. In the research analysis chapter,
 we delve into themes and key findings derived from literature analysis. Further, this research discusses
 components of the L.A.B.I. Model, its innovative nature, its impact on speech writing skills, and the role
 of technology. Synthesis and discussion highlight the model’s potential to revolutionize speech writing
 education by addressing both technical and creative dimensions.The conclusion chapter of the research
 briefly summarizes key findings and insights from the literature and data analysis. Research further
 underscores the holistic strategy of the L.A.B.I. Model, its adaptation to modern communication trends,
 its reliance on technology, and its focus on cultivating learning appreciation. The research discusses
 the implications for speech writing education and broader fields, proposing future directions for empirical
 research and comparative studies. The research chapter aids in concluding by confirming L.A.B.I.
 Model’s effectiveness in preparing speechwriters for success in the dynamic communication landscape.",

 "abstract"=>"This paper discusses the behavior of providing bank credit to SMEs during the people’s business credit
 (KUR) program in Indonesia. Since it was launched in 2007, the average NPL for these loans has
 increased. This indicates the existence of moral hazard behavior in lending by banks. To prove this
 indication, this paper implements a threshold regression model. Data covers 38 participating banks,
 which were observed during Q1-2008 to Q2-2021. The results of data analysis show that moral hazard
 behavior is indicated when NPL below or equal to 5.87%, on the contrary, experienced adverse selection.
 Specifically, moral hazard behavior is dominant in the case of investment credit and local government-
 owned banks. In working capital loans and others, this behavior also occurs, but not as in the
 case of investment loans. Moral hazard and adverse selection behavior were not detected at all in stateowned
 banks, while in private banks only occurred at a low level. At the end of the analysis, we also
 consider the shock effects of the global financial crisis (2008), European crisis (2009), and the Covid-19
 pandemic (2020-2021) on the threshold regression model, but the results are negative, thus strengthening
 our previous findings. In general, the factors that significantly determine the risk of non-performing
 loans in the people’s business credit program are the increase in credit growth, market share,
 deposit insurance interest rates, and economic growth as well as a decrease in the benchmark interest
 rate. However, the specifics are different, both in each type of credit and the type of participating bank.",

     number permanent magnet machines (PMMs) was methodically investigated. The literature revealed that
     fractional slot number PMMs use a variety of magnet structure configurations, including radial, parallel,
     and hybrid arrangements. Different magnet configurations were discovered to affect the distribution of
     magnetic flux density, thereby impacting UMP concentrations. The effect of various magnet geometries,
     including arc, rectangular, and trapezoidal, on UMP was examined. Moreover, the selection of magnet materials,
     such as ferrite, neodymium-iron-boron, and samarium-cobalt, influenced the magnetic field distribution
     and UMP characteristics.Due to their particular slot and pole combinations, fractional slot number
     PMMs were found to be more susceptible to UMP than other PMM varieties. Unbalanced forces caused
     by UMP resulted in unwanted vibrations, increased noise levels, and possible machine durability issues.
     Numerous factors influence UMP in fractional slot number PMMs, including the number of slots and
     poles, the length of the stator-rotor air gap, the magnet pole breadth, and the magnet thickness. The
     level of UMP was affected by the interaction of these factors with magnet structure configurations.",

     Bearing Ratio (CBR) were evaluated for varying percentages of glass fiber and rubber in the

     "abstract"=>"Wireless power transfer (WPT) has garnered significant interest as a potentially transformative technology
     in the energy sector, as it presents a novel approach to powering and charging devices. The
     functionality of this technology is predicated upon the utilization of electromagnetic coupling to facilitate
     the wireless transmission of energy between two entities. Despite the considerable potential, wireless
     power transfer (WPT) faces significant obstacles that restrict its practical feasibility. One notable challenge
     that arises is the decrease in power transfer efficiency as the distance between the transmitter
     and receiver increases. Moreover, the Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology is further limited by its
     reliance on accurate alignment between the transmitting source and the receiving device, thereby posing
     challenges for its practical implementation. The issues present substantial obstacles to the widespread
     commercialization of wireless power transfer (WPT). This study seeks to improve the efficacy of power
     transfer by optimizing the resonance frequency of the power transfer in response to the challenges. By
     systematically manipulating various parameters, including coil dimensions, input voltage levels, and operational
     frequency, a novel approach is proposed to enhance the efficiency of power transfer. The study
     additionally offers valuable insights regarding the correlation between the distance separating the coils
     and the efficiency of power transfer. The findings of this study offer a thorough empirical analysis and are
     supported by a strong theoretical framework, resulting in a substantial coefficient of determination (R²
     = 0.937118). This finding suggests that the linear regression model under consideration could account
     for approximately 93.7118 percent of the variability observed in the distance. The findings of this study
     establish a pathway towards enhanced and feasible wireless power technology, thereby establishing a
     robust basis for the prospective commercial implementation of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems",

    looks at how universities prepare students for work and what can be done to improve the process. Using
    a mixed method approach involving a survey of university students’ opinions, a focus group of hiring
    managers interviews, and interviews with lecturers, a holistic view is achieved from the main stakeholders.
    The stakeholders show significant dissonance among expectations. These differences stem from
    many sources, mainly, the lack of shared and open information. Students enter university without a
    clear goal or a realistic informed prospectus. Lecturers try to bridge the gap between what is expected
    to be delivered and what industry needs. However, lecturers are working against a tide of reluctance
    from students’ aptitude and abilities, faculty realities and fractured industries that do not share. Human
    resources personnel seem not to have a clear idea of what is expected from graduates, especially
    in a dynamic environment. What employers want varies widely, making training difficult. Even when
    students enter the workforce with the creative energies required, the established systems stifle growth.
    Having greater interaction among the parties would help reduce the differences in expectations.
    The interactions need to be continual throughout the students’ time at university. Flexible
    programs and more internships would allow students to better understand how what is taught
    can be applied. Lecturers would have access to more relevant data and with class discussions being
    more informed. Companies can structure onboarding programs better as students would
    have experience an introductory phase. More exchanges among stakeholders are required.",

    "abstract"=>"This study investigates the multifaceted impact of social media and online networking platforms on
    the shopping behavior of young adults in Ho Chi Minh City. By utilizing a mixed-method research approach,
    including both online surveys and in-depth interviews, with a diverse sample of 150 participants
    aged 18 to 25, the findings reveal a spectrum of influences on young adults’ purchasing decisions.
    It was observed that the authors’ names often relied on recommendations from friends and acquaintances
    they connected with through these platforms when making purchasing decisions.
    Additionally, positive consumer reviews and positive endorsements shared on social media
    platforms were influential in motivating young adults to consider specific products or services.
    Conversely, there were instances of negative impacts on shopping behavior. Participants reported experiencing
    social comparison, whereby they felt compelled to align their purchases with the trends
    and preferences of their peers on social media. This peer-induced pressure sometimes led to impulsive
    buying decisions, driven more by the desire to conform rather than genuine personal preferences.
    The study revealed a complex interplay of both positive and negative influences. While social media
    and online networking could provide valuable information and foster social interactions related
    to shopping, they also posed challenges related to impulse buying, overspending, and dissatisfaction
    with purchases.The research emphasizes the increasing significance of social media as a platform
    for consumer engagement. Participants actively engaged with brands and businesses through social
    media channels, seeking product information, discounts, and exclusive promotions.Given the prevalence
    of impulse buying and overspending observed, educational initiatives to enhance financial literacy
    among young adults could prove beneficial. Empowering them with the skills to make informed
    purchasing decisions may mitigate the adverse effects of impulsive shopping behaviors.As businesses
    increasingly tap into social media influence, ethical considerations emerge. Transparency in advertising
    and responsible marketing practices should be upheld to maintain consumer trust and credibility.",

    employer ratings, student feedback, and the relationships between different variables. The research
    objectives include profiling the students participating in the program, assessing employer evaluations of
    students’ performance, gathering feedback from students, examining the relationships between grades,
    employer ratings, and student feedback, and exploring the relationship between employer ratings and
    students’ performance. The study utilizes a descriptive research design and collects data through records,
    employer ratings, student feedback questionnaires, and surveys. Data analysis involves descriptive statistics,
    correlation analysis, and thematic analysis. The findings reveal that the majority of students are
    female, with a high percentage of students aged 21. Students generally perform well, with excellent attendance
    and punctuality. Employer evaluations indicate excellent performance in attendance, punctuality,
    performance, and general attitude. Students provide positive feedback, highlighting alignment with their
    field, challenging experiences, and positive working relationships. Correlation analysis shows no significant
    relationship between grades and employer ratings or student feedback. However, moderate positive
    relationships exist between grades and attendance, punctuality, performance, and general attitude. The
    study concludes that the practicum program effectively prepares students for the office administration
    sector, but recommends further focus on gender equality, career development, industry partnerships,
    continuous improvement, and feedback mechanisms. The findings contribute to enhancing the program’s
    curriculum and support systems, ultimately improving student outcomes and employer satisfaction.",

    "abstract"=>"The shift in the content of stewardship is possible because of an understanding that develops away
    from its original purpose. It is no longer the same as the inheritance that was declared to the next
    successor. This fact certainly applies to Christian stewardship. Recognizing the contents of the inheritance
    and how to transfer it to the successors of stewardship can be studied from Paul’s letter to the
    Corinthians. His first letters are in chapters 11 and 15. Through several textual approaches and developing
    the results of these approaches, three important words are found regarding the true heritage:
    parelabon, paradoka and paradosis. Concretely for the development of faith in adults in the articulation
    of didaskalia and pedagogy is rooted in those three words that Paul mentioned in the middle of
    the congregation. And its implementation is mainly carried out as often as possible among believers.",

 "abstract"=>"Science is dynamic in nature and with the emerging trends in the
 world of teaching, the methodology of the teaching process must
 be innovative to adapt to the current trends in education. Chemistry
 is often regarded as a challenging subject, an observation that
 sometimes discourages learners from continuing with their studies.
 Students prefer learning in a classroom where active participation
 is greatly encouraged, and it is desirable that Science teachers
 introduce strategies that will enable students to think of solutions
 that address scientific knowledge construction. With these, the
 researcher was interested in finding alternative ways to help the
 BSED Science major students improve their conceptual understanding.
 The highlight of the study was the use of manipulative
 instructional materials that will make learning and understanding
 molecular geometry more concrete and enjoyable, anchored on the
 constructivism theory, which views learning as an active process
 that results from self-constructed meanings. The study utilized
 the quasi-experimental design, particularly the non-equivalent
 control group design. Based on the results, there is no noteworthy
 difference between the conceptual understanding of learning molecular
 geometry using molecular models and the lecture method,
 and both are effective teaching strategies for improving the
 conceptual understanding of the BSED Science major students.",

 between academics and co-curricular activities. ARSC officers
 demonstrated adaptability by overcoming scheduling challenges
 and utilizing educational resources during disruptions. Their experiences
 informed the creation of a Matatag Student Activity Model,
 designed to back up the Matatag curriculum’s strengths and
 address potential shortcomings. This model integrated program
 planning, academic support, extracurricular, and socio-emotional

 "abstract"=>"In the quest to improve mathematics proficiency, it is worthwhile
 to emphasize not only enhancing instructional strategies but also
 developing a positive attitude towards mathematics. One of the
 things that hinder students’ performance is math anxiety, which
 interferes with cognitive and learning processes. This research
 determined the level and causes of math anxiety among students
 and developed an instructional material to improve their performance
 in mathematics. The study is an educational design research
 (EDR). Data on the levels of math anxiety were gathered
 from 307 Mathematics students, and the causes were examined
 through focus group discussions with 50 students and 4 mathematics
 specialists. Using this data, an instructional material was
 developed and pilot implemented in a mathematics class of forty-
 two (42) students. Findings revealed that 80.13% of the student-
 respondents had Average to High Math Anxiety. The causes
 of math anxiety were mainly negative experiences such as past
 failures, pressure to find the correct answers, embarrassment in
 front of peers, and strict teachers. Instructional materials that
 reduce math anxiety are easy to understand, contain varied activities,
 and incorporate additional online resources. Analysis of
 paired samples t-test conducted using SPSS resulted to a t-value
 of -12.513 and a p-value of 0.000, revealing that the instructional
 material significantly lowered math anxiety and improved
 the student’s performance in mathematics. It is recommended
 that universities expand guidance and counseling services to
 recognize math anxiety as an integral factor in students’ mental
 health and conduct a review of the mathematics instructional materials
 to evaluate their adequacy in lowering the math anxiety.",

 primary objective of this research was to assess the enhancement
 of social-emotional skills in 5-6-year-old children through
 the implementation of the project-based learning model at Samarinda
 State Kindergarten 9. The research methodology employed
 was classroom action research, encompassing planning,
 execution, observation, and reflection stages. The study involved
 12 students from the B3 class at Samarinda State Kindergarten
 9, and data were collected through observation, interviews, and
 documentation, followed by analysis using descriptive statistics to
 derive an average score. The research comprised three phases:
 pre-action, cycle I (consisting of 5 sessions), and cycle II (also
 with 5 sessions). Data analysis in the pre-action phase indicated
 a low average score of 39% for children’s social-emotional
 skills, which increased in cycle. But did not yet meet the predefined
 success threshold of 53%. However, in cycle II, the average
 score improved significantly and reached a success rate of
 79%. These findings lead to the conclusion that the project-based
 learning model effectively enhances the social-emotional abilities
 of 5-6-year-old children at Samarinda State Kindergarten 9.",

 "abstract"=>"English language learning attracts individuals from diverse linguistic
 backgrounds due to a global demand and is seen as a
 gateway to academic and professional success. Language anxiety
 is seen as a reoccurring issue among these learners of foreign
 languages. This research paper examines the relationship
 between language anxiety and foreign language achievement of
 learners by conducting a quantitative study with a sample of 80
 undergraduate students at the University of Tabuk-Haql College
 using a scale (FLCAS) to measure the levels of anxieties induced
 in the process of foreign language learning. A survey questionnaire
 was developed using Achievement Emotions Questionnaire
 (AEQ). The results of the research revealed a negative correlation
 between the two variables, stressing that language anxiety
 is a hindering factor in language achievement. There was no statistical
 difference found in FLA and its effect on language achievement
 based on gender among the students. The findings of the
 present research emphasize the significance of equipping educators
 with the tools to assess language anxiety among learners
 effectively. Foreign language anxiety can be reduced in learners
 by creating a supportive classroom environment, fostering encouragement,
 and developing interventions for situation specific
 anxiety such as fear of making mistakes and classroom participation
 can lead to more successful and confident language learners.",

     <b>Purpose:</b>
     This study aims to examine and demonstrate the impact of perceived
     security, perceived privacy, system quality, and utilitarian
     motives on users’ actual use of Google Drive in Indonesia.
     <br>
     <b>Design/methodology/approach:</b>
     This study focuses on attitudes toward use and trust as mediating
     variables in this relationship. The sample consisted of 115 Google
     Drive users who had completed the questionnaire. A quantitative
     methodology was adopted, utilizing path analysis with IBM SPSS
     Statistics 23 and structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS-
     5. An accidental random sampling technique was employed, and
     the questionnaire was distributed to 120 Google Drive users in
     Indonesia.
     <br>
     <b>Findings:</b>
     The structural model results indicate that perceived security and
     privacy influence attitudes and actual use. The relationship between
     attitudes toward use significantly affects the actual use of
     Google Drive among users in Indonesia. Likewise, perceived security
     and privacy significantly influence usage attitudes and relationships
     with actual use.
     <br>
     <b>Practical implications:</b>
     The current research is valuable for Google Drive users to illustrate
     the development of a relatively secure cloud-based Google Drive.
     <br>
     <b>Originality/value:</b>
     To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first academic
     paper to broaden Google Drive user adoption by examining the
     determinants of usage among Google Drive users.",

     face learning at Aglalana Integrated School, Dumarao Capiz,
     S.Y. 2022-2023. The specific objectives were: 1.) What is the
     level of motivation of indigenous students as a whole and when
     grouped according to socio-demographic factors such as age,
     sex, ethnic classification, family monthly income, parents’ occupation,
     and educational attainment? 2.) What is the level of engagement
     as a whole and when grouped according to socio-demographic
     profile? 3.) Are there significant differences in the
     level of motivation as a whole and when grouped according to
     socio-demographic profile? 4.) Are there significant differences
     in the level of engagement as a whole and when grouped according
     to socio-demographic profile? 5.) Are there significant
     relationships between the level of motivation and engagement?
     Respondents of the study were 47 indigenous students of Aglalana Integrated
     School who were 13-17 years old, males, with parents who
     were college level with a family monthly income of below 5,000.00.
     A descriptive research design was used, and an adapted questionnaire
     was utilized to gather data. Data were analyzed using descriptive
     statistics, mean and standard deviations while inferential
     statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Least Significant Difference
     (LSD), and Pearson Product Correlation Coefficient were used
     to analyze the inferential data and relationships among variables.
     Results showed that respondents had “high” motivation and engagement
     toward the face-to-face classes. It was also found there were
     significant differences in the levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
     as to grade level and sex, but significant differences in the levels
     of intrinsic motivation existed between fathers’ educational attainment,
     while the rest of the variables revealed no difference at all.
     There were significant differences in the level of engagement
     in terms of liking for learning, liking for school, effort and persistence,
     cognitive learning, and overall levels of engagement as
     to grade level and age. Coherently, a significant difference in the
     level of engagement in terms of cognitive learning as to fathers’
     educational attainment while the rest of the variables revealed no difference at all. Further, there were significant relationshipsbetween
     the levels of intrinsic motivation, ext-rinsic motivation,-

     clinics. It also made use of online poll surveys from known friends
     for prompt retrieval of data. Respondents of the study were the
     clients of Rural Health Units and residents of different Municipalities
     in the 1st District of Capiz. The study started last June 2019,
     and other pertinent data from the RHUs were gathered until October
     2019. Frequency, percentage, and mean analysis were used
     to interpret the data using SPSS. A huge portion of clients are
     females; almost half are at the age bracket of 36-45 years old
     and married. All municipalities had served 4,034 clients for the
     past three months. The farthest coastal RHU from the city had
     the highest number of clients served. Clients were highly satisfied
     with the services offered by RHUs in the Province of Capiz.",

     and explores the ethical implications associated with their implementation.
     The VMGO serve as the guiding principles for UCU’s
     strategic planning and decision-making processes, shaping the
     institution’s identity and direction. However, the effectiveness
     of these VMGO relies on their dissemination among the primary
     stakeholders, the students. This research aimed to assess the
     current state of dissemination of UCU’s VMGO and identify potential
     ethical implications arising from any gaps or shortcomings in
     these processes. The study employed a mixed-methods approach,
     combining surveys, document analysis and philosophical interpretation.
     The survey gathered quantitative data regarding stakeholders’
     experiences on the dissemination of the VMGO, while
     philosophical interpretation provided in-depth insights of ethical
     implication into their perceptions and experiences. Additionally, an
     analysis of relevant documents, such as official university publications
     and communication materials, provided contextual information.
     The study concluded that UCU can strengthen its commitment
     to integrity, teamwork, competence and transcendence
     that will foster a sense of purpose, honesty, accuracy, alignment,
     responsibility, respect, collaboration and societal impact within
     the university community. By upholding these values, UCU can
     strengthen its commitment to ethical practices, maintain the integrity
     of its messaging, encourage collaboration and inclusivity,
     enhance competence, and promote positive societal impact.",

     by dual-income earner couples to balance their work and family
     commitments. Via the comprehensive review of the literature,
     key themes and patterns in the strategies utilized by couples to
     achieve work-family balance are identified. These themes include
     time management strategies, communication and collaboration,
     flexible work arrangements, and self-care practices. The
     findings provide insights into the approaches couples employ to
     navigate the challenges and demands of dual careers and family
     responsibilities. The implications of the findings are discussed for
     individuals, organizations, and policymakers. Time management
     strategies emphasize the effective allocation and prioritization of
     time for work and family domains. Communication and collaboration
     underscore the importance of open and honest dialogue between
     partners. Flexible work arrangements are recognized as a
     vital adaptive strategy, necessitating options that accommodate
     the diverse needs of dual-income earner couples. Self-care practices
     are highlighted as essential for reducing stress and maintaining
     work-family balance. Organizations and policymakers
     can promote these strategies to support work-life integration.",

     experiences before coming to the orphanage, their coping
     mechanisms, and their aspirations. This is descriptive qualitative
     research anchoring from Stake’s model in conducting a case study.
     This study covered four (4) female orphans as case participants from
     the orphanage, whose ages range from 8 to 18, with different narratives
     and life stories. In this study, it emerged that their stepmother,
     stepfather, and stepbrother emotionally, physically, and sexually
     abused them as the majority of the themes they experienced. The
     cited abuse is considered one of the primary reasons that brought
     the children to the orphanage. The children’s coping mechanisms
     in the orphanage are positively affected by the people who saved
     and brought them into it. The activities in the orphanage, such as
     attending mass and praying, helped them strengthen their faith in
     God, eventually lightening their burden; other than leaving their
     negative experiences, the orphans’ aspirations in the orphanage are
     to finish their education and help others, especially their siblings.",

     <b>Research Aims</b>
     The purpose of this study was conducted to investigate the relationship
     between both organizational justice and organizational
     climate towards turnover intention, with job satisfaction acting as
     the mediating variable.
     <br>
     <b>Design/Methodology/Approach</b>
     This cross-sectional study involves conducting a survey among
     252 hotel employees in Sarawak. Pearson correlation analysis and
     Haye’s PROCESS model through SPSS macros model 4 were applied
     to examine relationships and meditational effects.
     <br>
     <b> Research Findings</b>
     The results indicate that 1. Job satisfaction mediates the relationship
     between organizational climate and turnover intention; 2.
     Job satisfaction mediates the relationship between organizational
     justice and turnover intention; 3. Job satisfaction is negatively
     related to turnover intention.
     <br>
     <b>Theoretical Contribution/Originality/Value</b>
     This study assesses whether job satisfaction mediates the effect
     of organizational justice and organizational climate on turnover
     intention and mend the gaps on inconsistencies found on the association
     between organizational justice and turnover intention.
     <br>
     <b> Practical/ Policy Implications</b>
     Hotels can implement a fair and equitable system within their
     organisation such as a performance-based rewards system, to ensure
     job security and stability can be offered to employees.
     <br>
     <b> Research limitations</b>
     This study was conducted within the context of Sarawak only and
     among hotel employees, and this study is conducted solely quantitatively.",

     The phrase ‘Public Interest Litigation’, commonly known as PIL,
is a relatively recent phenomenon in our judicial system. PIL refers
to situations in which concerned people or groups approach
the court in good faith for the benefit of the general public. How
indigent and helpless people can get help in court through PIL
and at the same time to ensure that no one is deprived of justice
irrespective of his lack of qualifications, ability and financial
conditions is the main focus of this article. It is a method for
bringing societal anomalies to the notice of the court in order to
obtain effective remedies for the most vulnerable sections of the
society. Attempts have been made in this paper to investigate the
factors that may give rise to public interest litigation. It has also
been tried to develop a comprehensive idea for understanding
the fact that public interest litigation is necessary to guarantee
equal justice for all and prevent the infringement of human rights.

     Tourism is one of the industries hardest hit by COVID–19, and
the Department of Tourism suggested digital tourism as one way
of stimulating, at least, domestic travel. This study sought to
determine the actions of resorts and the government interventions
about it. The study applied mixed methods of research, total
sampling population, and hybrid interview considering travel
restrictions using a validated self-made questionnaire. The study
was conducted in Northern Mindanao, Philippines. The respondents
of the study were employees of beach and water-themed
resorts and municipal tourism officers. The findings of the study
revealed low usage of digital tourism strategies and poor tourism
performance, a significant difference in digital tourism strategies
of the resorts and their employees when grouped according
to profile, and a significant relationship between digital tourism
strategies and the tourism performance of the resorts. Policy
gaps were also discovered. The study concludes that the level
of usage of digital tourism strategies can only do so much given
the status quo. Hence, recommendations for the enhancement
of digital tourism strategies are suggested since they align with
the state’s existing medium- and long-term development plans.

     This paper explores the concept of organizational communication
by tracing it from the perspective of Levinasian face-to-face dialogue
in today’s contemporary interpretation of management in
general and organizations in particular. This paper made use of
positivist and constructivist philosophical frameworks for research.
The data were gathered using a questionnaire checklist. The data
were described, measured, and tested to interpret the perception
of the government employees in face-to-face dialogue.The results
implied a weak application of face-to-face dialogue where face-toface
communication with superiors is not fully observed and there
is a high degree of communication barriers. There were a few individuals
who hoard information and benefitted from the information
they were hoarding. Inter-departmental communication was not
fully observed, and face-to-face dialogues were not being utilized
to improve job performance and meet organizational goals and objectives.
Information from colleagues was not always accurate and
detailed. This paper has implications for organizational, leadership,
and managerial as it imposes behavioral change by anchoring its
concepts from the Levinisian perspective of face-to-face dialogue.

     Sexual abuse, vulnerability and trauma are not new. These incidents
are constant in all levels of society. The story of Maggie
Sullivan portrays the traumatic life experience of Maggie Sullivan,
which portrays the truth of the world. Jennifer Down has
portrayed all the characters in such a way so that readers can
instantly connect with them. The story talks about a little girl
that has faced sexual harassment and has been raped by a man.
All the incidents have made her life difficult, and the discussion
that she has made was greatly influenced by the circumstances
and the past experiences that she had faced earlier in her
life. Down has beautifully portrayed all the emotions of Maggie
that allows readers to develop an emotional and empathic connection
with her instantaneously. Her experiences and life lessons
have transformed her life in a certain direction that she
has never dreamed of. The transformation of her life and all the
phases of life have allowed Maggie to switch her life that she
thought was right for her. She has tried her best to survive and
chase happiness from others, but eventually fails sometimes.
