                                  Currently, he is collaborating with Joining Welding Research Institute, Osaka University Japan, to develop a friction stir welding process in a sustainable way that can be implemented in Malaysia's manufacturing industry. The project explores the possibilities of joining similar and dissimilar materials such as polycarbonate/aluminum, aluminum/stainless steel, magnesium/steel, and aluminum/copper for various applications in the automotive and semiconductor industries. Analysis of welds using Transmission Electron Microscopy for joints with carbonaceous nanomaterial additives such as CNT and Graphene for the purpose of enforcement is his current passion. He was awarded the Distinguished International Associate from the Royal Academic of Engineering UK for his project on friction stir welding. He actively applies for research projects and has secured various research grants from domestic and international funders. He has completed supervision of 4 PhD and 8 Master students, and is currently supervising 10 PhD and 1 Master candidate.

Dr. Yang, joined the editorial board to explore research on Engineering Problems and Legal Challenges in Urban and Rural Low carbon Development in CURRENT INTEGRATIVE ENGINEERING journal. This topic has enormous research potential and is also one of the most cutting-edge scientific issues at present. Urban and rural renewal is a necessary supplement to the development of high-speed urbanization. Rapid development will lead to a large number of problems such as overproduction, energy waste, and unbalanced resource allocation. These problems will reduce people\'s quality of life and the sustainability of future development. Discussing more new low-carbon building technologies in urban and rural renewal can effectively solve the conflict between people\'s increasing demand for quality of life and high energy consumption. At the same time, we also have to face up to the imbalance between urban and rural development. Although regional economic development is different, people in different regions have the right to equal healthy living environments.
