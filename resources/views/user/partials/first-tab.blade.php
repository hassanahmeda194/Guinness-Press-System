                concerns regarding journal policies in the cover letter as well.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Title:</h3>
            <p>
                Authors should aim for a concise title for their manuscript, ideally
                spanning 10-15 words and directly reflecting the research topic. It's
                advisable to refrain from using abbreviations or shortened forms. Kindly
                adhere to these guidelines when crafting your submission's title.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Authors' Name and Affiliation:</h3>
            <p>
                The title page of the manuscript should list the full names of all authors,
                accompanied by their current affiliations, digital identifiers, and email
                addresses. Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of this information is
                essential for efficient communication and appropriate attribution.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Article Structure: Subdivision - Numbered Sections</h3>
            <p>
                Please organize your article into distinct, numbered sections. Subsections
                should be labeled as 1.1 (and then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and so on), 1.2, and so
                forth. Note that section numbering excludes the abstract. Utilize this
                numbering system for internal cross-references, avoiding vague references to
                'the text'. If necessary, provide concise headings for each subsection,
                ensuring each heading begins on a separate line.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Highlights:</h3>
            <p>
                While optional, we strongly encourage authors to include this section, as it
                could enhance the visibility of your articles. We invite you to summarize
                the key points of your article in 3 to 5 bullet points, enhancing its
                discoverability on search engines. These highlights should be submitted as a
                separate, editable file using 'Highlights' in the filename or provided as a
                distinct section within the manuscript. Utilizing 3 to 5 bullet points, each
                within 85 characters (including spaces), can significantly enhance your
                article's online visibility.
            </p>

                <li>Acknowledgments</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>17. References</h3>
            <p>Guinness Press Journals adhere to either APA reference style. Here are key
                points to consider when citing articles:</p>
            <ul class="tab-list">
                <li>Maintain Consistency in Citations: All references cited within figures,
                    tables, or text should also be listed in the reference section of the
                    manuscript.</li>
                <li>Author Count and "et al." Usage: If there are 6 or fewer authors,
                    include all their names. For references with more than 6 authors, list
                    the names of the first 6 authors followed by "et al." to represent the
                    remaining authors.</li>
                <li>Include DOIs: Ensure to include the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for
                    all cited articles at the end of your references.</li>
                <li>Published Articles: Include only articles that have been published or
                    accepted for publication. For published articles, provide the page
                    numbers or article numbers.</li>
                <li>Accepted Articles: If an article has been accepted for publication but
                    is pending publication, indicate its status as "In Press" within
                    brackets.</li>
                <li>Avoid Citing Data Under Peer Review: Guinness Press discourages citing
                    data that is still under peer review by any publisher.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>18. Manuscript File Formats</h3>
            <p>For submitting manuscripts, the preferred file format is Microsoft Word,
                either in DOC or DOCX format. Editable files are essential for the review
                and production process. If you initially submit a non-editable file, you
                will need to resubmit your manuscript in a Word file.</p>
            <p>Consider the following points:</p>
            <ul class="tab-list">
                <li>Utilize double-line spacing.</li>
                <li>Include both line and page numbering in your document.</li>
                <li>Ensure that any special characters used are properly embedded within the
                    text, as they may be lost during the conversion to PDF.</li>
                <li>Avoid using page breaks in your manuscript</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>19. Figures</h3>
            <p>
                In accordance with the regulations detailed in the Image Manipulation
                section of our Ethical Guidelines, authors must obtain permission prior to
                incorporating copyrighted figures or any segment of a figure or table,
                ensuring strict adherence to the requirements of relevant licenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figures should be positioned near the corresponding text rather than at the
                beginning or end of the document, and citations of figures within the text
                should follow a sequential order. Figures with multiple parts should be
                consolidated into a single file containing all components (a, b, c, etc.),
                with each figure not exceeding 10 MB in size. When utilizing graphs, labels
                including units should be provided for each axis.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the manuscript is submitted in LaTex format, figures should be submitted
                in PDF. Following acceptance of the paper, separate figures may be necessary
                for production purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authors are reminded to obtain approval from the original copyright holder
                if figures are reproduced from any published content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Image Size and Resolution:</u>
            </p>
            <p>As the final manuscript version will be in PDF format, figures must be
                prepared to align with this format.</p>
            <p>
                <u>Dimension Requirements:</u>

                <li>For double-column figures: Width should be 180mm</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Resolution:</b> Ensure figures have high resolution (typically 300 dots
                per inch or DPI) to maintain quality when printed or viewed on-screen.
                Verify resolution by enlarging the figure to 150%. Blurriness indicates
                insufficient resolution.</p>
            <p><b>Font Size:</b> Ensure text, labels, or legends in figures are legible at
                expected dimensions. A font size of 8-10 points is usually suitable.</p>
            <p>
                <u>Acceptable File Types for Figures:</u>
            </p>
            <ul class="tab-list">

            <ul class="tab-list">
                <li><u>Table Citations:</u> <span>Tables should be cited in sequential order
                        within the text section of the manuscript. It's essential to include
                        all citations, and tables must be provided as editable Word files,
                        not images.</span></li>
                <li><u>Table Layout:</u> <span>The table caption should be positioned above

            <h3>21. Supplementary Materials </h3>
            <p>
                Guinness Press publishes supplementary material alongside articles to enrich
                content and provide readers with valuable resources. For manuscripts with
                innovative or extensive methodology sections, we encourage the inclusion of
                supplementary online materials, such as equations, data treatment methods,
                syntax code, example data, code books, case descriptions, research context,
                and detailed narratives. Additionally, images, sound clips, and method
                applications can further enhance your work.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any changes are necessary for the provided supplementary file, please
                submit a completely new file rather than providing a correction list or
                annotating corrections on the previous version. It's important to note that
                supplementary files are published as provided, and no formatting is applied
                from the Publisher's side.

            </p>
            <p>
                Please be advised that supplementary material will not be incorporated into
                the manuscript but will be linked on our website in the format provided by
                the author.

                <u>File Format and Size</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's essential to ensure that each additional file represents a single
                table, figure, or movie. Please avoid uploading linked worksheets or PDF
                files larger than one sheet. All supporting or supplementary materials
                should be consolidated into a single zipped file, not exceeding 4 MB in
                size. For data sheets, we recommend using Word, Excel, CSV, CDX, FASTA, PDF,
                or Zip formats. Presentations are best provided in PowerPoint, PDF, or Zip
                files. Images can be submitted in CDX, JPEG, EPS, TIFF, or PNG formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                For supplementary audio files, kindly provide them in MP3 format, and for
                videos, use MOV, MPG, AVI, or MPEG formats. Supplementary images must be in
                300 DPI, and RGB color mode should be utilized.
            </p>
            <h3>22. Language Editing</h3>
            <p>
                Prior to manuscript submission, authors are encouraged to have their work
                reviewed by a native English speaker or to utilize professional language
                editing services. This helps minimize the risk of rejection due to language
                inconsistencies. Manuscripts containing grammatical or typographical errors
                will be deemed ineligible for publication and will be returned to the author
                with a recommendation for correction before further consideration in the
                publication process. Authors are encouraged to seek professional editing
                services to address any language inconsistencies and errors in their
                manuscripts.
