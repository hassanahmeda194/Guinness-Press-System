                            At Guinness Press, we believe in making knowledge accessible to all. Therefore, we do not charge
                            any submission fees. However, to support the publication process, we have Article Processing
                            Charges (APCs) of $300 that the authors or their funding institutions typically cover.

                            Guinness Press recognizes that some authors may face financial constraints in covering
                            publication fees. To support such authors, we provide a limited number of waivers for
                            publication fees to those who meet the eligibility criteria.
                        </p>

                            Eligibility for fee waivers is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration
                            factors such as financial need and the potential impact of the research.
