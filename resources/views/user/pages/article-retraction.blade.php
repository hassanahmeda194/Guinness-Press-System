                        Articles published by Guinness Press may be considered for retraction under the following circumstances:
                    </p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">
                        Substantial evidence exists indicating the unreliability of findings due to significant errors (e.g., miscalculation, experimental error), fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism.

                    <h5>
                        The article constitutes plagiarism.
                    </h5>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">
                        Findings have been previously published without proper attribution, disclosure, or justification, leading to redundant publication.
                    </p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">
                        Inclusion of unauthorized material or data.

                        Failure to disclose a significant competing interest that could unduly affect interpretations.

                    <h5>Retraction Notices:</h5>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Notices of retraction will adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Specify the entity responsible for the retraction.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Published promptly to mitigate potential harm.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Linked to the retracted article in online versions.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Clearly identify the retracted article by including its title and authors in the retraction heading.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Clearly indicate as a retraction, distinguishing it from other types of corrections or comments.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Provide the reason(s) for retraction in an objective, factual manner, avoiding inflammatory language.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Made freely accessible to all readers.</p>
                    <h5>Crossmark Link:</h5>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">
                        Clicking on the Crossmark logo will tell you the current status of a document and may also give you additional publication record information about the article.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Cases Inappropriate For Retraction:</h5>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Retractions are typically not warranted in the following situations:</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Dispute over authorship without undermining the validity of the findings.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Main findings of the work remain reliable and can be sufficiently addressed through correction.</p>
                    <p class="poppins_fonts">Reported conflicts of interest post-publication will be evaluated by the editor. If deemed unlikely to have influenced interpretations, recommendations, or conclusions, retraction may not be pursued.</p>
